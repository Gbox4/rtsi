Cry about my BABA losses.  Sell my shitty BABA for 50k loss and put remaining 70k into something actually good. Likely ICLN or TAN.
Are y’all holding up on my PLTR. It gonna pop sometime soon.
GOOD MORNING
C'mon guys, I need a chrimbus special miracle today
Never doubt Cathie Wood!
Ready for the squeeze? If I say it everyday it will eventually be right.

Gamestop? More like CumInMyAssStop am I right?
Please ANSWER should I do VXX lotto calls or GME lotto calls?
Does working on Christmas count?
Gme gonna make sure we have money for presents
Yes, and true
Oh no. I just got back from getting T/O from subway on base here in Germany and the guys behind me were talking about PLUG, LAZR, and QS. This is literally the top. These guy are probably 19 and been in military for a coup of months.  The one guy said QS is the next Tesla. 😀😀😀 You literally can’t make this up.
Alright looks like QS is dead , and my calls are super dead
I would like to submit my application for wsb mod. This is my platform:  1.	⁠I am a bisexual trader so I can reach across the aisle to ban smooth brains of both persuasions. 2.	⁠I will always be accesible and responsive because I have no life outside of wsb 3.	⁠I make disgusting retarded comments here. That’s what I call “character” leadership 4.	⁠I make dumb YOLO trades. That’s what I call “policy leadership”
Ath today. Pltr, tsla 🚀 🚀

You’re never alone. You have all your tendies with you. 🌝
Right
No you can still get blow job at work
I guess it's better than buying a Mustang/Camaro at a 24% interest rate
GME to $35 today. My DD? My dick hurts.
 GME finally moving
GME not updating  for anyone else? What's going on here? Limit up?
I would trust cathie with my life.........savings
I think you meant 28
Up 3%
sell low buy high
An almost obsolete company went from 15 to 22 within two days. That was the squeeze. Of course, there may be more in the future, but are you guys seriously expecting KODK levels of ridiculousness?
How does that distinguish you from the rest of us?
**I CALL THIS THE GME CYCLE**  GME has a 20% week, posts flood this subreddit, kids are screaming the squeeze is happening! the squeeze is happening!.  Few days later, GME reverts back down 10-20% but usually makes a higher low.   All the GME posts dissapear, kids come here calling it a pump and dump! Is Ths SquEEzE sTILL hAPPEninG/??? Im lOSing All MY moNey On 50% oTm WeekeLIes  All the retards lose their money..  Gme moons past its 20% week to a higher high and the posts come back, everyone saying nows the time...  Literally like clockwork since september. Its actually hilarious at this point
During a pandemic? I thought that was the point
BABA black sheep   Have you any wool?      Yes Sir, yes Sir   Three bags full
The 🌈 in me is saying to sell but fuck it. It’s Christmas! What’s a good exit point?
PLTR PREDICTION &gt;!29.00 -&gt; 29.65 -&gt; 28.50 -&gt; 28.23 -&gt; 27.4 -&gt; 28.7 -&gt; 29.05  🤡😭 !&lt;
This guy probably shorted at $12
Should’ve rode that FEYE rocket longer. Sold my calls for +750% last week but I could’ve doubled that
Brexit deal announcement within the next 30 mins  You may now return to not caring
You have my vote.
it has 600 pre market volume lol. no one is trading it right now
So QS with no actual product is the second most valuable auto stock (TSLA is the first) in US? Someone help me understand
Dear Santa, all I want for Christmas is the GME short squeeze.  Oh, and if the elves could finish tinkering with the 2k stimmy that would sure be swell. Thanks!
My RH is not updating anything. Anyone else having this problem
And no one reads the actual DD
$200!

Is there any way to keep wsbsynth playing on mobile? It fizzles out after 5 or 10 minutes of my screen locking. I'll pay for a mobile app
Volatility look more useful to me right now than waiting for TSLA to break a new high like I usually did. An ancient gaming retailer is a weird choice though, but money doesn't care. Will buy the next 15% dip.
Approved
Gotta woo the dependapotamuses somehow!
never ever
What sector do we rotate into today? Last week it has been a bit of meme stocks and green stocks
Jesus, what a year. If it weren't for the stock market and this sub, I'd probably be addicted to heroin by now.  Thanks retards... you're like one big, dysfunctional, surrogate family.
For the love of gos, its down 20$!!!
sell the rip buy the dips and hold some leaps. gme has followed the same formula for the last year and a half. not stoppin now
I will never invest in China ever again.   Indian is my next target for growth.
Pleas fly again VXX
It’s dead
Yea I hate that, it stops on PC too.
Hmm, gonna need to find a bigger stick to poke it with then.
I use RES and love how much green I see when I come into these Daily Discussion threads. Bullish af.
I think you can hit play from the Lock Screen
420-370=50 vetoes.
Maybe in January

50% of my portfolio is now $ARKK and $ICLN. Got some LEAPS left in $PLTR that I'm selling CCs on.  Got some $DM and $MT lotto tickets and the last bit is 100% $EVER calls. I told everyone about $LMND a few weeks ago but even I paper handed a potential 20 bagger into just a 5 bagger.  Not making that mistake again, $EVER 50 EOY
Nice one bro you totally owned him
Get in $EVER tody. Gonna be a repeat of LMND.
I never see anyone mention ENPH. Shits basically a 2nd tesla. I remember trading it at $30 last year. Damn.
U only lose money when you sale
Alright fuck it, I've gotten trapped many a times on BABA, first at 270 and then at 260 everytime going out with a loss but I'm sure this time will be different 🤡
The dollar is an absolute joke right now, Jesus fucking Christ.  There's literally no point buying US equities right now from the UK, I purchased some a few days ago and I literally need about a 5% return just let break even. Fuck's sake.
Someone buy those 18 GME shares at 23.50
Is TSLA a boomer stonk now?
I take that back. I was trading it at $14. God damn
Why not much longer? Microvast is a crusher.
bruh i sold for a loss when it went from 50--&gt; 40 thinking the fraud was real
They also said no sales or revenue for 5 years lmao
yes its very annoying.... Hoping it will regain value in the next year or so, just gota keep your money in USD to realise more gains
Lol I feel bad for OP, I feel bad for myself, but you're not wrong.
Why are there so many singular trades of literally 1 or 2 shares that get spammed after-hours/pre-market? Who the hell buys and sells one share of a $9 stock to begin with, but especially why are so many trades executed of it AH/PM? Is it just ppl trying to set the stock price where they want it?
It doesn't moon fast enough for people here. But it's kinda like SQ, just goes up and up and up.
Damn who wouldve thought puts on Baba before eod yesterday would print bigly. Tf Baba
I used to own 2k shares at $18. Sold it at $18... 🙂
BABA pleas fly again
TAN is where it’s at
Fuckk feelsbad
are we buying this baba dip?
Having products and earnings is bearish in this market son
When is solar week on retardstreetbets?
Hey, calls may be the play at open. Might buy some fd lottos for the fuck of it
Y’all remember back a few months ago when ENPH was being investigated? Lol we had puts printing and shit and it drilled to $35, then fucking overnight all the mfers bought the dip and it opened up like 6% next day and wiped out all gains.
Yeah if Tech could dump that would be great. Also if you guys could have those TPS report on my desk by the end of the day that would also be great.
PLTR it's time to fly once again
Where do you live so I can go slap you for such blasphemy!!
Partial limit orders getting filled and bots
I think I will have to buy the dip for the fifth time. It's sad, but what choice do I have. Give up?
apple is back to being boomer i see. glad i sold all my positiosn except 1 call lol
Why is it so hard to just make 4k in a week. I swear I'll quit after that..
Good thing I start buying around August, if you had EUR or GBP exchanged to USD at the beginning of the year and you're already not doing hot on the returns.... GUH
GBP is historically very weak... after Brexit it could strengthen a hell of a lot more than this, watch out
CRM tear-based lube circle jerk meeting starts in 20 mins. My place
I am not touching that chinese shiet anymore, I am leave 15 260 mar fuking calls that cost me more than 14k! Not avg down, not selling
Can you shill me on EVER
It sucks, been thinking about putting money into a broker like tastytrade to get options access but if I do it'll probably be a 10% loss by default at the rate the dollar is tanking. Then again I have been trading us stocks so I'm allready taking the loss anyway, and getting double fked because my local broker charges like 8 dollars a trade so.....
Hi GOEV, pleas fly again
with that attitude youll never make 4k in a week lol
$AAPL is EV stock now. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Shill would imply I know what I'm talking about.
I'd give anything to go back to early March and replay everything again and fix my massive mistake which was buying TSLA puts. I'd be a god damn millionaire right now had I just bought calls instead
It’s not too late to get on the Triterras bandwagon.  Merry Christmas!
I went all in two days ago
Sorry to hear
lol i would not touch it. not sure how much i will fall
Best day to plant a tree was yesterday. Second best day is today.
Enough with this played out stupid meme. GOEV is going straight to Venus and it hasn’t even dipped. Shutup.
Shoutout to all the W.S.T., A.S.T., and H.S.T. degenerates here like me.
Why am I so addicted to watching futures. It literally does not benefit me at all to see them. TAKING THESE VXX CALLS TO THE GRAVE 🐻
K K K K
People here want Jack Ma to tap out so they can suck Xi's dick instead, I couldn't be one of them for sure .... 🤡
Just gonna sit and watch the pltr morning dip.
GM is worth more...
Perfect for theta gang strats imo. I’m running call diagonals to profit off theta and IV until eventually PLTR moons
Just buy (E)LYS guys, its not that hard.
What is going on with (B)ridge (T)o (W)(N)? Any news?

Please fly again icln
All in on Canoo baby; this company has flown under the radar at such a low market cap. And the Apple partnership rumour is super interesting.  Feb $25 calls, let’s go!
Does anybody think MVIS will keep continue to go up or drop?
VGAC options 🚀

Elon should have X now so it’ll be exciting again. Tesla is now a boomer stonk, Neuralink and Elon rocket company should go public so we can pump.
BABA dip. Going all in
Nice
you either die at zero or trade long enough to see yourself become a boomer

I bought Apple leaps. We'll I make it?
Lmao because they’re going to start *production* in 2024? I’d rather gamble away everything on VGAC
From 8/24 to 10/26 I went from +31% to -56%. How’s that work?   As an additional bonus: From 10/26 to today I went from -56% to +24%.
So, I got about 10k to spare on same day options. What’s on your mind
GME question: Why did they always take PS2 games out out of their original cases and tell them in those crappy generic ones in the late 2000s?
STIC is the new meme stonk, lift off is imminent 🚀🦮
Still, congrats and fuck you
Greed got to me, didn’t sell at 9.50 now back to 6.90. Hopping it goes back up somewhere near that range again .
VGAC shitty ass SPAC. Rather throw all my money into $QS rather than VGAC at current prices
What is this weak ass market
People need to put BABA and ZM on their ‘do not touch’ lists. Pure lottery plays any direction.
Something up with GameStop RN. Melvin Capital fucked
I'm a buyer of USD right now  buy low sell high  no one can time the bottom with 100% accuracy
you have my vote then
Wait you *don’t* want to get in on a SPAC before it moons?
As an American I didn't realize this at all. Scary because I kinda want to buy puts to hold over Christmas weekend but if what my spidey sense detects happening that weekend is a collapse of the dollar then puts might not even be good since the value crash might not be reflected in dollars
[deleted]
Why did you guys stay up to watch the paint dry
If GME closes above 23.5 I will buy 3 people on this sub copies of 13 sentinels (from Gamestop of course). Only the smartest video games for the smartest bestest people on the internet.
No
Don't worry. We'll be at high teens early next year. This was never supposed to be a day trade. Stay comfy and know you did the right thing.
Stilling holding Mara should I be worried about a crash?
I watched few episodes. Was nice.
They were probably used games that other people returned for store credit without the case
The big short is better, followed by margin call.
MT...?
So Alibaba Group is getting [sued](http://www.samr.gov.cn/xw/zj/202012/t20201224_324638.html) by the Chinese Govt for monopolization of the market
first time watching GME or something? nothing out of the norm is happening
I know, I gotta pump those numbers up.
Sadly not to the chinese kids, they were abandoned by their BABA 😭
Wow, BABA super cheap. Gonna add those bargains to my Wirecard and Nikola stocks.
At the same time, the us market is the place if you want to trade options
Tesla will never be a boomer stock
It’s funny, I tried talking to real people about electric vehicles and they were like “da fuck you talking about dumbass, that’s like 20 years in the future!! We don’t even have gas stations in some parts!”  Then I remembered EVs are only a thing here
BABA leaps? Or it’s gonna keep tanking?
🧲🦾🚀👆🏼

If you’re worried about tomorrow, my best advice is go smoke a blunt, do a qb sneak with a cold one, and prepare for your surprise tendies
Puts
GME $21 12/24 is the way.
Shut the fuck up, you commie bitch.
I know it’s Low volume but ytd had some action at least
jan 08 $30 call here
Checking 2/3 boxes. Nikola was too retarded, Even for me.
I had a dream GOEV dropped to $15 and I bought more calls. Maybe I need to stop checking the price so often.

Leaps are too safe. Sorry
this is average volume for gme pre market.
visited the Nikola sub yesterday. In absolute shambles rn
ENPH is one of those stocks you look at and think I'll get some on the next dip and it never does!
Buy TRIT after 10am pull back. Venmo tendies eod
Try telling people about pltr
Why are they talking about tracking Santa with F-16 on a TV channel kids don’t watch? (CNBC)
Okay, so McCarthy in the GOP is not opposed to unanimous consent as long as the ridiculous amounts of foreign aid are re-examined. Pelosi has to agree to that right? Let’s hold off on all of those “promoting gender studies in Pakistan” type items and keep it simple.   I need SPY to get to 370 so don’t fuck this up, Congress (even though I know you will).
"should I be worried"  a question that doesn't inspire confidence  I don't hold investments that I'm not confident about
Why do people only talk about PLTR when Peter Ts other SPACS are killing it.   BTWN is about to merge with Indonesian eBay and destroy the competition. Up 20% in premarket.
Who thinks today will be santa rally
Where the fuck do you live that doesn't have gas stations?

TRIT making up for my recent losses 🚀🚀💵💵💵
Just happened for me a couple days ago after being locked all year. Been playing with the less than $100 in my account and made $12 on a $50 RAD call just to prove to myself I can do better than I used to before I transfer in the $1000 I've got coming to invest. Be careful friend, "slow and steady" wins the race (but really, accepting 20% gains overnight instead of constantly chasing ten-baggers is still fucking fast not quite "slow and steady")
Check out the latest Canoo vehicle release video, the compare it to the Apple M1 release video. They are super similar in styles. I could definitely see an Apple/ Canoo partnership... 🚀
I always appreciate seeing the intense retardation in this sub. Thank you solider, carry on.

Option 1: today floats along on super low volume and theta gang eats and we all waste 5 hrs of our lives Option 2: it runs like crazy on increase stimulus hopes and we are all going to have stockings full of blow  Place your bets
who else wakes up even earlier during the week when you don't have work. I fucking love getting up early when it's not for work.
100,000kms on my 2018 Tesla model 3 say you’re dumb
I made a quick grand (from like a $10 yolo) on PLTR so I spread the love by saying PLTR in online games all chat once in a while, pretty fucking funny when someone says they lost all their money on it LOL nobody ever knows what the company is tho
Whats reasoning behind not dying before Christmas. Dont ppl take profits before xmas
oh fuck, mine comes back today too  i wonder if it's a christmas present from the SEC
Nah MP was cool before MT. I remember the MP DD when it was $23.
I genuinely have no idea what to do today
Hahahah Peru, there are some places outside the city where you don’t see gas stations for miiiiiileeeeeeeeeeeeees.  It’s kinda like the Death Valley in California, but bigger. You cab find gas from random people selling it but no gas stations
Is BABA going to go to 0?
Do u have a source that confirms it ?
CRM is such a load of shit. I’m seeing my calls at -50% loss today as want the capital in BTS
Remember 2018?
U dropped this 🖊 on ur way to giving a blowjob
thats the dream baby
If CCP eventually decides to break up Alibaba group that stock is completely fucked. Good luck out there
The world is bigger than just America
China is going to zero.
Yes
They’re both based in California and Canoo already have a B2B partnership with Hyundai where they stick a chassis on Canoo “skateboards”. This makes so much sense for Apple.
Ur a pussy ass bitch
We are not supposed to shill BTWN yet
I don’t live in America. See how I listed mileage in kilometres
Haha yep, I got this banned when I was playing like a complete idiot. Been honing my autist skills on ToS. I'm ready!
Yeah, I know, I was joking about the obvious value trap
Good.
not sure yet
If it’s Option 2 I will suck my own dick while calling out your name.
the chad strat:  skim the daily thread and look for retards who are insecure about their positions and inverse them
Gobble gobble
Option 3: MMs bait us with movement on all our meme stocks, sell us a bunch of FDs that are worthless by EOD  Everyone loses, theta gang eats popcorn on the sidelines
I am very bullish for the year end. All the retards will get cash and checks from their families for Christmas and pile them into stonks and call options - we will be taken to new heights. May create a hangover in January though
Is there a better sound known to man than clappin' cheeks?

So much bearishness on this stock. Bottom almost in
This works 10% of the time all the time.
Buying 1000 shares of FEYE today and 1000 of MT. Cyber and steel will run in 21. I already see what rebar is costing on a project I’m building and it giving me nightmares of what the prices where in 08-09.
Time to load up on OAC / For Hims to get you hard!
Buying the dip on a company that the Chinese government declared to be it's enemy is like buying life insurance of people you actually see locked in a burning building.  Don't do it.

Daaammnnn THATS right, we’ll anyhow, I know that first world country’s have nice electric infrastructure but there are also other country’s which don’t.  At least I’m sure you can agree that the electric infrastructure needed for EVs is still in early stages
Just back from Nikola World and I've seen the Badger in person. They were underselling the specs in the video above. Th Badger can go at the speed of light and it would take a nanosecond to go from 0 to 60      All hail the Badger!
So your advice to deal with trading/investing stress is to get fucked up first thing in the morning

ICLN calls, ARKG calls, PLTR shares, BTWN shares
Wasn't trading then, I stand corrected nonetheless.

This is the smoothest brain take I’ve seen on here in a while
TDOC to 300 its inevitable
Canoo is literally the first EV company that hasn't just copied Tesla.  It's gonna moon, just a case of when... Probably when all the dumb dumb analysts get around to covering it.
jag/redbull, nicotine, wsb. we're in this together buddy.
When theta crushes all these GME contracts it will be fitting punishment for people who should have remembered the first time they ever had their dreams crushed by a little dollar amount on a screen it was the value of their used system and controllers and games at GameStop
you can downvote my posts but you can't downvote my tendies  i have pltr

Nice dd.
‘Twas the morning before Christmas   When all through the market;   Every Cathie Wood fanboy wondered     “What stocks did $ARK get?”    Us autists were up early   Scrolling r/WallStreetBets;   While Chads fucked our wives and   Visions of Lambos danced in our heads.    When deep in the options chain    There arose a great fuss;     Citron Research put out a hit job   On our daddy Elon Musk!    Now GameStop! Now Palantir!   Now Tesla and Nio!   On SPACs! On JPow!   How much money can we YOLO?    To the unemployment line!   To flipping burgers at Wendy’s!   Now gamble away! Gamble away!   Gamble away all your tendies!

That is extremely unfortunate. She won’t be able to give you a reach around anymore :(
Calls 12/25
I can honestly say.. I don’t know what my plays are going to be today. I don’t have much buying power and most are tied up on calls expiring next one. Well the closest one is GRWG expiring next week 12/31 which I’m up 90%. I might sell that and buy something today before market close

buying weekly puts on doordash has been my biggest mistake so far. sentiment has been bad. everyone on every forum says it is overvalued. citron set price target to 40. Yet it just won't tank.citron was able to tank palantir but for some reason doordash rises like a phoenix.  makes no sense.

i'm kind of similar in that way i guess, i tend to play devil's advocate without really taking a stance or side, but i don't think people take me less seriously because of it. rather they tend to just ask questions rather than engaging. and then i look like an idiot because apparently i can't actually come up with an original thought, i can only argue with others

\+3 5/21 15c  \+1 1/22 10c  \-4 1/8 28c  Will wait until day of expiry to roll my short strike. If PLTR has mooned by then, I would've captured max profits on this spread. I can hit max profit even if PLTR drops a bit, so I don't mind a bit of downside.
Okay, but PLTR, what if : you pumped but (HEAR ME OUT ON THIS) did not dump? hmmmm

Ask around for  a good Doctor of PT in your area. I used to go every 2 weeks to the chiro. My GP referred me to a PT and I'm 100x better. I  t does cost more, but now I go in once a month for a sports massage. It's the most painful hour of the month but I feel like a million bucks afterwards.  I hope you get some relief though. Chronic pain really is no joke. Painkillers are addictive on their own, but now that I'm a little older, I can only imagine how addictive living pain free is.

There is no use of talking about Winnie the Pooh. He is always power hungry and will be power hungry. This jokema made jokes on Chinese banks. The result is waking up Winnie the Pooh dark mode. They will push jokema hard such that no one will dare to make jokes on Chinese banks/ economy. Let’s see how low they will take BABA before showing kindness.   PS: I don’t hold any position in BABA currently but I love to. IMO one of the most beaten down powerful company in the world right now. BABA literally owns many golden unicorns in south east Asia.

Seriously think this is mismatched vs the way other enterprise tech is being valued. Especially with CLDR reporting non gaap profits. Lot of companies valued way higher in similar lines of biz are negative.

Whats the play on BABA? It has literally dipped back to what it was in May-June and most likely all the news on investigation might just end with a few new rules. Tired of buying dips on it for over a month now. Thing of going heavy on leaps if it stays red for 2 days.
How often do you mean by a lot?
It’ll probably hit $20 by then. Current price is a bargain imo
How we feeling about PLTR today, boys?
It’s very likely btwn. Needed to buy a few weeks ago probably too late now unless deal is announced
Target price?
Every time Apple opens green and every time Apple is green after hours.   So like twice a day
What numbers say it’s a bargain?

Was thinking about buying today at market open but it's up 23% since yesterday. I'm gonna wait for it to drop.
Buy the rumor. Currently up 20ish% since yesterday morning.   I usually buy stocks and sell once I hit +20%/-8% so this was a good play
You are a good man. Have a snek
Their stock price history doesn't engender confidence, why the spikes and sell offs?
This is what we've been seeing a lot over the last weeks, the strikes did trend up. Last week it was pinned at 27 and week before that 25-26.   Seems like progress.

Totalitarian Capitalism?
Definitely buying leaps and shares on this Baba dip.
I initially shorted the 40c, 35c, 30c, and now 28 (I was catching PLTR as it was falling to hedge my long position). The 28c but still has a ton of extrinsic value. Also, since my spread is set up properly, I don't mind (though may not *want)* hitting my max profit. Can easily just re-enter the position with new spreads (can widen or tighten as needed).   On 1/8 if PLTR is still trading around $28 or so, I can most likely roll up and out for a credit, thus getting paid to wait a bit longer to collect more profit.
Why the fuck am I killing myself working in finance when girls on social media and only fans make triple what I earn

Yeah good reminder.
that seems like an issue with the people though, not necessarily the nature of political discussion.  i've always hated the politics ban on this sub. ban political posts sure but it should be allowed in discussion threads specifically, it's just too relevant to disallow. not talking about political shilling of course

More like national socialists

We don’t do that here.

Bruh sorry to say but Peru isn't the world either. Clubbing all third world countries into one bracket doesn't make all of them equal. Most car manufacturers are deeply invested into electric cars now, if they weren't in it 2 years ago.
It was 10% I believe. They must have rebalanced.
My portfolio says otherwise

Anyone else just loaded the boat with BABA shares?
I’m not sure if that’s good or bad

I bought some. Not full position just in case

brexit deal not done yet, brought down futures a bit
You don’t criticize the leader of China and get away with it if you’re Chinese. I wouldn’t touch BABA with a pole personally. I went to Beijing in February. Four or five cameras stacked on top of each other on every street corner all pointed directly at your face. Very dehumanizing. China does not fuck around.
Last year and a half has been an anomaly. It's not guarantee it will keep same pace in 2021.
Atm calls jan/feb, or boomer stocks selling theta cakes, imo
Your logic is undeniable
So glad I got out of BABA.
👑 thank you king
What, Jack Ryan?
It means current price action is meaningless so far, if about 1.000.000 shorts must cover today.
Keep talking!
It’s cool I’m up %1000.80 just from the past two months and I don’t have anyone to brag to but you
Its doing coo too. Respect
This hell hole sure as hell isn’t the world either, that’s not the point. You just said it, most car manufacturers are invested on it sure, but your regular Joe who lives and works 8/5, saves the bare minimum and drives a Toyota doesn’t know shit about electric vehicles
Yes!
Just buy the underlying stocks they are listed
[removed]
I agree, fuck the CCP
Anyone lucky enough to be holding baba puts?
I would argue it takes money to make money, and you don’t get money by always starting over at 0%.
I see so the price doesn’t reflect much yet. So if they have to cover gme could surge today no?
a shitty dell one, what should i be looking for?
Tree fiddy hours

Baba calls...
Of course the nature of political debates depends on personality of participants, but there are certain human traits which are very predictable.  Political discussions, especially when it’s about a polarizing person like Trump will lead to nowhere.   Political posts are definitely allowed on discussion threads. Just saw a huge discussion ( read name-calling) about Trump veto of stimulus and spending bill.
i would argue i'll kick your fuckin ass

Hilarious you think you have more money than boomers. The entire political apparatus has been setup to funnel money from the young to the old. See student loans, see social security, see tenured professors, see defined pension plans that no longer exist for the young but still have to be paid for by them, etc etc.
Going in on streaming stonks. Christmas day is one of the business days for theaters. This year people are going to be signing up for disney+ (Soul), hbo max (WW84), hulu...everyone already has Netflix. When those new subscriber numbers come out 🤑

Gap to fill at $5.80. May buy shares if it fills there.
🌈🐻nonsense
yeah i guess that's true and i'm arguing for the way i think things should be rather than the way that they are.  and it seems hit or miss in the discussion threads. i got suspended once for making fun of the big thing at the DNC about biden's stutter but i've also gotten away with more blatantly political stuff so idk, seems like it's not as heavily moderated but you might get busted
I’m guessing it was ultimately paid for by tax payers, like our football stadiums?
That's bad bro. Let me give you a more extreme example. 1 share has been sold for a total of $20. His saying there is no volume, you don't know the price until there is volume.
SPY pleas fly again
Wait you mean trading twitter &gt; WSB?
Good. Fuck you for investing in communism.
I will never forget December 24, 2018. I was just approved for options and went all in on calls.   We had one of the largest crashes in years that day. Ruined my first account that way.
SQ predictions for today with the Tidal news?
I see 50 comments in a row saying “buy baba” and I check on that flaming pile and it is down NINE PERCENT in the PM?!  Imma go read why, but y’all high on crack if you are buying calls on that atm.
and Cathie is life
I would invest, I imagine they are profiting a ton from this sell off
You can build your career. They have what’s known in finance as a “depreciating asset”.
Who is getting into BABA next week?
You ain’t shillin hard enough son
Which call ?
I got it at like 11pm. Had dreams all night it went to $40 before I could buy.
$IPOC calls on the dip.
Right I got that part.. but about the 1 million shorts needing to cover today, that could drive the price up
Only thing we dumpin is loads in ur mum
Glad that BABA takes all of the attention today. Buy calls!
When is SPCE taking off
50?!? Come on. That’s no less than a $100 stock!
Yeah what's new about that
QS calls
I came this morning to say XL moonshot incoming
I'm not able to do options, so the question is,   I'm currently $500 into tesla, and $500 into MT.  Is it too late to hit GME?  I'm yet to be diagnosed as a retard so I just want to get going with decent profit by learning.  I have about $3500 in a 5% month gain fund so 1k is my play money.
Proven market manipulation yesterday, gonna rise higher again next few weeks.

All the dip buyers at 260s and 50s are now all dead but sure keep buying 😂

Hell yea. Jim from The Office is awesome in it.
Xi Jinping anally screwing baba retards lmao, imagine buying Gyna stonk
Yeah, the only thing protecting him is that he is known worldwide not even money,    There was a Chinese Billionaires that got killed abroad in France when he was there for a vacation.

Off today from work, so glad I can be undisturbed and watch myself lose money

It depends on georgia. Dem takes Senate's, biden can spend trillions on infra.    Dem lose georgia, mcconnell will obstruct and force infra spending lower.  This includes tax credits for solar, so watch out for TAN and ICLN to dump.  Dem win Georgia, yolo into $CLF
Get ready boys, Santa is coming and we are going green.
As long as it melts to 380

Call your bank or better move to the U.S. jk, just ca your bank
I was given all the foresight in the world yet kept averaging down BABA. Now one of my largest positions ever. Going to wake up in a world of hurt. Someone please hold me 😢 fucking china
Yeah but Ma invoked the ire of King Pooh. I bought in at 265 thinking that was surely the low point and at the bottom of multiple moving averages. Nope. Not even close. Bailed on my calls at a 30% loss, thank god I did.

I sure know how to pick ‘em 🥡

RemindMe! tomorrow
yea it wasn't a lot of money I was just starting out gambling but it still hurts deep inside ;)
Feels bad, best to project the worst case scenario before open and just come to terms with it, and then maybe, just maybe, it's not as bad. All about setting the expectations right.
This why I don’t like to invest in Chinese companies. I screwed myself with LI and still holding that bag
Those and people with money care about it. It's not only the market who will decide if electric vehicles will succeed. Govt policies are also changing to enforce climate change conscious manufacturing. California is planning to ban sale of gas powered vehicles by 2035. UK by 2025. The average Joe will be forced to get an electric even if he doesn't give a shit about it
I think you fell for that hedge fund manager end of year manipulation crap, steel ain’t going anywhere for a while, you might just as well hold. My take is that there will be a dip until the government announces infra modernization investments
When you have a literal square block head you do dumb shit
Pltr going to be 29 forever
GME 23 eod get in while you can!
PLTR or PS5???  Give me the PLTR!!!
Baba is safe.  Lots of chinese investment firms and pension fund own it.   Baba and tencent are to retirement funds what housing is to canadians.

Supply side jesus would've kept the market open today and tmr
My opinion is it's more volatile to buy in the AM as that's when the market is working out the direction it's heading. Other than that I'm comfortable buying anytime.

Oh you've got a good chance at survival too? Sympathy revoked, fuck you buddy. I hope you get overrun by immigrants ganking your shit for being dumb enough to think you could just kill them all and pretend you're a cool guy and get away with it. Don't forget to trade against me whenever I post options positions so I can take all your money before you catch on to the real world and start using it to build a bunker or something
You are switching now? how do you survive so long on the darkside and not get whiped out? And why did you change your mind?
$23 *EOD* are you crazy? I mean maybe in some sort of bizarre fantasy world. $24 minimum.
I yolo'd the $1,200 and turned it into $200 😎
Nice
Will ah trading still be open after 1 pm?
Hello
This
Now my JD calls are getting scorched along with BABAs. Lovely
Yeah because they stole our technology. If I was Silicon Valley and you were China. I would have you and your kids build my shit. Of course you’re going to have my tech because you’re building it. Let me guess you hate Trump too right?
Ok.
FCEL up another 25% today would be a Christmas miracle. 🎅
there’s no such thing as private property ownership in China. that is the people’s money. Jack Ma is fucked.
With the Chinese government being this involved, I’m not touching BABA until it hits $200.
Following
Nobody tell him
BABA calls...🧐
Because it manufactures fugayze, fugazy, fairy dust
What calls to YOLO at open bois ?
Lmao, I saw your comment the first time. You investing at the top and complaining that it's the Chinese' fault is two completely separate points which identifies you as a shit ass trader.
[removed]
Look at the 2 week chart there's a triangle thing forming. Uppers.
Imagine entrusting China your hard earned dollarinos.
FCEL to 15 EOD
Careful BABA, stealing the spotlight off some whores around here...
We can't let China drag down our market on Christmas Eve with this baba nonsese... They already destroyed our whole year
Or google
Yeah till 5
what does that have to do with the context of their conversation ?
Let that be a warning on any pump, in any thread.
Getting plenty of cash today, need a good 2022 leap.
Jack Ma under investigation for moneyopoly, buy poohts
GME to 12
Gotta avoid doubling down too much otherwise one loser can wipe you. I got in baba @265 avg at my normal position size and while I dont like the losses it didnt fuck me over at least. I wont have &gt;10% of chinese stonks at any single time due to ccp fuckery
Aren’t we all? She so fine.
Dont do it

*for all the poors out there:*  You can watch CNBC for free through Thinkorswim they provide free channel access without any commercials even for paper accounts on phone app and on pc.
China sure likes to fuck with its own asset. 6 months of gains for the stock wiped just like that in the past two months
Do you remember when FSLY offered an earnings warning?  Remember that it dragged NET with it? And NET shot up at open?  Here's your chance with JD.
Icln
Y'all think if I spend the $600 on a new bike I'll get some puss? Or like should I get a scooter? Which one gets me more coochie?
The moment these fckers turn bullish, were at the top

Sweet. Thanks!

That $600 shit? I'll make that bitch into $2.75 by the end of the week. I'm just built different 😤

I'm in a dip buying mood this morning. BABA, you look pretty in your red Christmas dress!
Is BABA a dip buy opportunity
When psth
Perfect continuation of the bear flag. No recovery overnight. Oh yeah today is for sure red.
That would be lovely

The door’s that way ⚰️
Rollerblades are making a comeback.
Which one of you sold me these $T $31c?  Can I get a refund?
I’m switching now because I know when I switch to calls it’ll be the top. I know this because last time I went into calls it was MSFT 200c back in late January/early February
Inferring what's going on PM by scanning the stickied threads here is one of the best games to play. I do it every morning.

damn baba is going for cheapies right now... this is free money right? Guys?
How can I learn to be powerful like you? I YOLO'ed my 1200 and the wife complained that we were supposed to buy groceries with it. I've been sleeping in the basement since

I don’t have as much money as the rest of you. But making over $100 from one stock was awesome

How much is shitron going to get paid to become a hitman on GME?
Fuck that. 50/50 which way TSLA gonna go
Can someone poke BABA with a stick to see if it’s still alive
First problem is right there, gotta ditch the wife, I haven't felt the touch of a woman in 22 years, I haven't even lost my virginity because I NEVER lose
They prob bought puts before they released the news. That shit is legit over there (and in the us apparently too if you look at congress...)
Has anyone called JPow yet? Why isn’t he buying up BABA already?
probably cocaine
Omg omg! A GME bear, these were thought to be extinct. Quick, take pictures guys.
well now it's certainly gotta be free
Buying BABA calls at open  godspeed
So my feye puts printing or what

He looks super unhealthy to me for some reason.
INO 🚀
The CNBC app offers it all free too though they do show the same commercials as on tv. Also can listen to it as an audio stream.   Just FYI if you want it on a second screen from your trading
All good now.
If you bought baba at ATHs youre down 28% right now
Don't be stupid, or at least stop lying. This isnt true.    https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_property_law
Stop holding and trade the PSAR ya dummy. Buy puts when it crests, sell in the troughs, buy a call, repeat
Seriously laughing so hard at that and my wife is actually asking why and I'm in deep shit if I tell her
My uncanny ability to pick the biggest fucking losers to put most of my money in continues. BABA, I hate you.
BTWN, Thiel, PLTR, Kark, Skynet. It's all connected. Let's feast on the demise of humanity. Gods shooting off to the stars. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Was gonna go for a run before market opens but it’s fucking 30 degrees outside fuck now I have to smoke weed and drink coffee until open
If you’re getting a refund I want one too
I was gonna sell for a loss at open but since it’s down this much I’d rather just hold see how it plays out and maybe average down......investors acting like China is killing alibaba
QQQJ
So my company sent me a gift card. It shows under "Other" on ADP along with medical, 401k contributions etc. Does that mean they actually fucking deducted the gift card from my pay ?????
Which would you rather they increase and which do you think should go?
*dont*
**[Chinese property law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese property law)**  Chinese property law has existed in various forms for centuries. After the Chinese Communist Revolution in 1949, most land is owned by collectivities or by the state; the Property Law of the People's Republic of China passed in 2007 codified property rights.

Why’s that
If we don’t get a Vito post today I’m going to shit bricks
pltr not moonin 🥲
I’d personally stay away until it hits $200. We’ve had this discussion for months. I was called an actual retard for saying BABA would hit $250 before it hit $300 again. Well... I even underestimated the Chinese government getting involved.
Brexit trying to wrecks it
Calls holders down 99%
Yeah you can watch that too on it
Merry Christmas, fren!
Stonks falling
I’d let it bleed today. Maybe Monday.
Because the bureaucracy is infinite expanding, and they need infinite funding to support it.
Anything ark or icln  Or I’m a big fan of spy. Cuz you can day trade weeklies against it and still have a pretty solid asset that should go up over the year
By “Drilling” its down to only up 13% pre-market. Do you know what words mean.

Good call
I wouldnt rush into it. It wont have an immediate rebound and 90% of people hate the ccp. The stock might take a few hits between now and its recovery phase.
Buying a PLTR leap at open. Then next paycheck I’m buying another PLTR leap. Then next paycheck I’ll do the same until I’m rich
Arent there places where you can trade in gift cards online for like a 20% loss. Might be worth,  if it was Texas Roadhouse though I might've kept it. Those rolls with that cinnamon butter are something special

They finna put out a hit anyway now. Good buying opportunity though.

Market is flatter than my ex GF boobs
BABA is such an obvious play, an easy $50 per share in next few months id say
Thanks for the info, i feel like i am switching to a 🌈🐻 this last week.  Still on the 100 long exposure train. But thinking hard about a 30-50% cash position.

Uhhhh....
I’m starting to think meme stocks may be the only way to make money. Every stock I get into stays flat or immediately tanks. Nothing makes sense
Feels like it wants to go lower...
Imma keep it a buck with you guys, sometimes I don't even make plays, I just come on here and say dumb shit like "Tesla is gonna be $450 by the end of the week just trust me bro"
true
The CCP must be making a killing $250 puts are a 60 bagger at the min on the open. You don’t think those Communist fucks are inside trading on this news?
Now go out there and put some shrimp on that barbie! Merry Christmas you beautiful cunt!

You’re toast. I am as well. I was up huge on Dec 31 callas the Monday before thanksgiving man held them thinking Baba would go back to $300. Woke up the Monday after thanksgiving to US govt delisting crap and it was over from there. Lost $10k

Reinfections are common given the opportunity [[1]](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/khsw6u/scientists_urge_concern_not_alarm_over_new_virus/ggo8qir/). Reinfections can be used to estimate anti-body half life for anti-bodies created by the vaccine. [[2]](https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/antibody+half-life). Reinfections can also be used as an indicator for B cell immunity, as B cell immunity created via a infection is the same as B cell immunity created by a vaccine. [[3]](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html). Yes, vaccines do provide a greater initial antibody count than a natural infection, but the anti-body half life is the same and short as indicated by reinfections. Bi-annual vaccine boosters are not logistically feasible.  If antigenic drift reduces efficacy rapidly, its a problem. Its not possible to vaccinate for multiple versions bi-annually. [[4]](https://twitter.com/trvrb/status/1340409968818671616?s=20). "Immune Evasion" can already be seen occuring in the South African strain [[5]](https://sciencespeaksblog.org/2020/12/22/covid-19-south-african-variant-may-be-worse-than-uk-variant/).

Of course they are, communism is for the people. Like not the government.
I tried to deposit a DoorDash gift card last week and it didn’t work sadly. It’s basically cash so I don’t get the problem
So buy the BABA dip or what
I agree with the Texas Roadhouse sentiment. Definitely the best lower cost steak chain restaurant!  The gift card is for Longhorns, Olive Garden, Cheddars, Bahama Breeze, Seasons 52, and Yardhouse. I can cook better steaks and make better Italian food. Maybe I’ll get Cheddars as I don’t know what the last three are at all.
McConnell is to the GOP as Goodell is to the NFL Owners. He does things that help the owners out and publicly he takes all the bad PR, because apparently he has plot armor in Kentucky.

Haha tell your wife they really aren’t a problem xD
You are racist if you aren't going to buy this BABA dip.
STIC (shares), MGNI, PSTG, QQQJ (Jan-Feb calls)
Can someone explain to me why the warrants are lagging the stocks in for example T.H.C.B and GO EV ? and how long would one have to wait before converting the warrants to shares?
Can I Poor man's Covered call on RH?
BABA is gonna go down and trade sideways for months. Y’all have fun bagholding that
feel like such a dumbass for selling FCEL shares @ 2.50 in october lolol.
VBA me dadi
Perfect time to buy JD's dip, China is only after BABA. Play it right for some big gains
Set a sell order and hope for one of those 1 second clearinghouse spikes to ATH that happened the other day. Then hope your platform is fast enough too. But I’d like to think Santa will take care of you today.

I’ll reply again since you deleted your post or got deleted:  “All this said, I'm not concerned that these variants will significantly reduce vaccine efficacy in the 2021 rollout. Most circulating SARS-CoV-2 viruses do not have any mutations in the spike receptor binding domain”  “However, we may see modest reductions in vaccine efficacy due to antigenic drift and will likely need a process in the coming years by which we update the spike variant used in the vaccine to best match circulating viruses.”  From your source.
315p wow are you hoping for another March meltdown?

Probably because it is in the checkout line at their local Kroger. Sadly, I don’t think much thought goes into it...
Either way ur fukt. if you roll over to feb/March and China keeps clapping ma’s cheeks or if the market has any type of pull back at the first quarter of next year at the presidency transition you’ll be even more mega fukt
22/23 10c leaps on Aphria are dirt cheap
No need to thrash our society. Solution: let a few boomers die. We're so caught up in denying reality that we've forgotten that the future lies not in keeping individuals alive but in giving birth to the next generation.

After its broken up maybe, they're obviously guilty of the things they're being accused of.

If they did you should see the difference in your net. But it's most likely they added it to your gross so it would be taxed as required by the IRS.

Absolutely will not happen imo, the uncertainty and lack of preparation/information is what crashed the markets in March.  I’m retarded but even I can see the actual effects of the virus aren’t having an effect on the market, just policy and lockdowns. Even If Biden says we’ll have to go into years-long lockdown I don’t think it would look like March
What is the standard time till expiry for it to be considered a LEAP?
👆exactly
Meme stocks are the only reason I'm up this year, I would be much richer if I never bothered with /r/investing
Is Nio violating antitrust laws?
They always want something for free.

We are in spac seaSon
Wow, 9% in pre. Whats the news?
Take a $3k L on XPev now or hold errr

Let’s go FCEL, let’s go! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Anything beyond 0dte is a LEAP for this sub lol
Haha trust me I have. She saw some thing on Huntsmen spiders and snakes in toilets and is convinced it's the norm.  Totally unreasonable but she isnt getting over it. Maybe I'll have to get her like hypnosis or something see if I can get her to get over her fear

Xi making an example out of alibaba.  He is putting jack ma back in line, reminding the local markey no company is greater than the party.  This will keep all other china companies inline for years to come.  My baba calls will be -99% after today.

Does anyone actually enjoy this? I’m up pretty big all time and I just feel awful all the time worrying about this world.
69 day ban?  Nice
u/silverlink22 did you buy puts on BABA? Of course not 🤣
PLTR ATH HIGH TODAY MERRY FUCKING CHRISTMAS RETARDS
Someone talked me out of buying the ICLN tip. I'm here for advanced financial advices.
What's up you fellow sad fucks that don't have family to spend enjoyable time with at Christmas so go on here instead &lt;3
330p tops
PLTR will tank today
then you aren't up big enough
That guy was a riot, sure miss him
It’s actually the only thing that makes me feel ok.   The thought of going back to poverty gives me crippling anxiety
Visionarymind tryna tell us something. Anyone speak emoji?
Absolutely. Utilizing reverse psychology I know that when everyone does one thing, you always do the opposite.
Hard to tell with this shit, but I took a 2k loss on hyln that would have been an 8k loss if I hadn’t paper handed

Then cash out and take a break
I can’t wait to watch GME get crushed.

Thanks for your kind words. Just hard to estimate the opening price for the calls. I will put a sell order for my buy price
Buy stocks bro
I never made money on Apple so fuck them and their shitty phones.
I dont even know what Cheddars is but good call
Holy shit, baba really drilling to hades. Condolences baba holders
Agreed. They mess up the iced coffee 75% of the time to the point where it’s almost not drinkable too. I don’t know how they’re still in business with Krispy Kreme and Starbucks as competitors
NIO is at a good level, and the BABA news will probably make it cheaper.
🍏🙏✈😢
Help I invested in BABA this week and now this guy named margin keeps calling
Vix is down and he hasn’t even tweeted today? You saying later today?
👅 the tip of my 🍆

Docu
I was told market would rally during the holidays..  yet this entire week has been as flat as a pancake
Lol
Merry Christmas upside down friend!
Good morning folks...I’m back  What’s the play today? My FSR - in the money @ $17....looking for that to hit Looking to buy the FSLY dip...any suggestions  What else is there to play today?
Good because I have 130k sitting on 12/31c
Penny stock but do the dd on t/r/c/h
early close should mean early open!
Shut the fuck up
Coronavirus is overblown and buy VOO is his core message
This lady on Twitter yelled at me for suggesting that you could use spreads to avoid PDT
You don't have the degenerate gambler gene then.
I mean baba is pretty much doing the same thing as we speak. It wiped out thousands of investors today
Yeah! That’s what I was saying to some retard yesterday. He told me, “ThAt’s NoT hOw It WoRks.”
Then pick a stock and go semi long and don’t be a pussy
The top
Wife and daughter have covid and I'm stuck in our guest room. Gonna be a weird one . Thanks for the love heart same to you
No, I wish lol. -10% for fucking BABA. Holy shit someone is about to be rich at open.
If you aren't making money off chinese markets and taking a small part of their GDP for over here, the communists have won. Don't let the uyghurs die for nothing. Do your part by stealing chinese money for our use.

Yikes. When it dips back down you may want to buy back in

Baba 200 by open
family does not equal enjoyable time, I'm autistic
Taking profits and spending the rest of the week with your wife. If i miss the santa rally then i miss. Been a great year nonetheless
Can’t wait for PLTR to pump first thing at open and then go from +4% to -4% in the span of 3 minutes 😃
It’s not too late to hop back on the train
Does China have a Palantir?
Baba might go under 100$ by February

YO WHY THE FUCK ARE WE NOT HEARING ABOUT ANTIBODY TESTS   30%+ of the pop already had covid if you look at recent studies and take time into account   We don’t know if having vid makes you immune (but most viruses that are beaten by the immune system create some immunity response so probably) but what the fuck I want to know if I have had it and I think this is pretty pertinent info, they can detect the antibodies in blood with great accuracy now so what the fuck is this, I wanna know if I had the vid shouldn’t be some guessing game and why now news on this fucking eh
Pair em with short shorts and a crop top and you're in business
It’s massively overvalued.
This FNGU dip lookin sexy
Let's do dis.
Lol fuck you bruh.
Feels too late
people see BABA free falling and immediately think DISCOUNT!!!  no company is too big to fail in China, good luck.
Instead of bags of coal, Santa delivering ded baba 300c’s to the naughty boys and girls this year
WSB is pumping GME so my guess is it’s going to spike to $25 after 15 mins, RH will break, and it will be down to $17 after 30 mins.
They’re hiring like crazy, Microsoft is scared of them, and institutions are still buying in on these dips
Pleas fly again

I won't say they didn't receive any government money, because I have no clue. But as a one-off example, Marion County previously let Padua Farms leave instead of offering tax incentives to stay.
Decided to follow the wsb tradition of "buy high sell low" with my BABA leaps.   Going to either put that money in psth
pleas fly
Seems quiet here today.    Like only the true ~~gambling degenerates~~ investors are out and about.
I’m not stopping till I can buy a house in cash
Why is XL down in premarket for no reason?
After doing all the math, they deducted it from my pay. Fucking wow. Email sent, as nice as i could possibly be about it.
None, I choose life.
They hid inside Karn’s asshole
I keep averaging down on BABA premarket but looks like it’s gonna go to 0
Lmao

Because it’s pretty expensive if I remember correctly. Also if you had it you can get it again a few months later.
May Santa bring you your tendies
Still a LEAP if you buy right at open on expiry day.
unless winnie puh makes 3 comanies out of one
Just go get a antibody test. It's around 180 bucks
Really trying to resist baba 0dte cause I know I’ll manage to lose money as it trades flat
I'd rather get the coal
retard i dont own it but it's dragging down our markets
stop thinking that having diamond hands makes you a badass ... just cut the loss now before it grows and move your money into something smarter
Baba is safe, Jack Ma on other hand..
CCP: What a run the past month for all. But as traders looking for short exposure, $BABA is no longer a stock but a full casino. Does not take a ball of crystal to know this will fall back to Arda. Shorting with a $200 2020 target
I’ve been saying this... people need to be getting the antibody test, not the Covid test, prior to doing their holiday travels
Ive heard that before  (Fellow bag holder)
If I could watch new release movies at home rather than theater, I’ll do. Fuck overpriced, up-sold theater garbage
BABA is pretending to fall premarket  🚀  🚀  🚀  It will moon by EOD  🚀  🚀  🚀  Buy the dip  🚀  🚀  🚀  Get in now!
Because it went up 90% yesterday you fucking retard
Vaccines make money, not antibody tests...
This shit better tank at open. I need to get rid of these puts.    Gonna move into Fedex calls and LMND puts and see which one blows up my account the fastest.
This. No harm in it. I got a bit obsessed with checking WSB and RH, kept slowly leaking money and was feeling bad so I stopped for a couple of months. Bought TSLA and stopped checking.
HOLIBABA
Sell it.now. try to make some.money back by selling call spreads..then move.on to something else
Get on board BFT. Before it takes off
BABA?
Why was it up 100% yesterday for no reason.
This is a bit optimistic...
lol
its the same thing everyday it seems, yet i still cant seem to play it right
Theta will fuck you on 12/31. Stick stick with 1/8 if you have to do less than a month
Yeah, it's the Chinese government
I’m holding a lot of PLTR so I hope you’re wrong but it DID open green.
We're the ones who caused that jump yesterday
If you retards aren’t buying into FCEL now, what are you waiting for? This stock is easy money with the Biden admin

From Stocktwits:  “new court filing yesterday in Jeff Xu’s case. Parties filed joint motion and proposed order for entry of “take nothing judgment”. Means exactly what it sounds like.

Anyone that blindly buys the BABA dip today is truly retarded. There are dip buys that are good and bad based on stock. This is a bad dip buy. Do you want to buy INTC next? 🤡

Ford is mooning right now
They are extremely inaccurate thanks to their false positive rate. If you get a positive on a test, there's something like only 55-60% chance of you actually having covid19
stop buying, wait after i buy calls first
Yesterday took 25c GME calls for 1/15. How does it look will it print?
Baba going sub $200 today

A reminder to all you autistic somabitches out there.....market closes at 1pm EST today. So no panic posts about  your Robinhood App.

It got a 60 dollar price target by analysts. It is not unusual for an asset that is very undervalued to rise quickly.

It’s going to drop to 20 soon GL

You’re crazy.
Sounds nice doesn't it.
I just got the ab test. Just ask your doctor to test for covid igg.  For what’s it’s worth I’ve been knee deep in the shit since March working on a covid unit in ny. I’m a lazy fuck and just wear a droplet mask. No n95. Never wear a face shield nor a gown. Only when management is around but I work nights so that’s like never.  I never had covid nor had symptoms and my ab test was neg yesterday
Bruh. In kaladesh’s inventors fair, they confiscate the winning prize, a planear portal. Only thing is, u can’t send non living things thru the portal.
If you’re up pretty big then go back to making the level of trades you started with.  As you make more money you usually risk more with every trade. You won’t get rich quick but you’ll at least not be stagnant.
Every dollar up GME moves is $10k from my calls. Let’s GOOOOoOoOoOio
My options are flat but the underlying asset is going up? What gives man?
2 share baba fellow retard, are we holding or averaging diwn with fractional shares?
After discovering WSB, you can’t afford heroin. Congrats!

Sir, this is a 🚀.
You’re gonna be disappointed
Imagine not going in MVIS
Ahh ok cool
wtf does nio have to do with the baba shit
GTFO It's up $0.02 in premarket trading.
You are crazy this isn’t a dip.. this is China stepping in and telling them they are getting to big for there britches.... I’m yoloing puts
Good luck to you bro, I was tempted last night but seeing how much further it fell overnight got me scurr.  Hope your Christmas is great and your baba boldness is rewarded!
What if alibaba gets broken up after chinas monopoly investigation
If BABA actually opens around 230 I may be forced to buy the fucking dip
Harry is not loyal? 😱
Cleared the dirty dishes out of my room, loaded the washer &amp; cleaned the sink, got some laundry done and did 100 push-ups  It must be the holiday spirit or something but it feels way better to wake up and get something done before open (6:30 in Cali)
Exactly
Thank you, and merry Christmas to you!  I'm really excited about the growth potential of the area. Between WEC, we also have new warehouses from Amazon, chewy, FedEx, autozone.  Ocala is already home to the largest custom firetruck factory in the world, the largest medical marijuana farm in the state, and our Sheriff made INTERNATIONAL headlines by refusing to let his officers wear masks.  Lot of poor people here that may be lifted out of poverty.
Literally bought both last week, no shame!
And moved the money into something else that’s moving. Something to be said about dead money. If he sold Airlines at the bottom in April/May and dumped it all in TSLA, then what?
Average down on baba calls ?
Damn Baba just keeps getting destroyed. Should have bought puts when it was in the 300s.
Puts on BABA at open?
After I fucking sell after holding for 6 moths of course
Maybe. I still think the squeeze isn’t happening yet and that it’ll retract some, then flatten for a while. IV is insane right now, so FDs are still pretty expensive.   FWIW, I bought 12/24 $15.50c on Monday for $0.55 when GME was trading around $15.00 (and then sold on Tuesday for $3.00...not a big bet, just 10).
Not really.
Thanks for this, I’m selling my calls at open and gonna buy back eoy
Stap makin soft things hard.
But if you can't send living things through, how tf is Vorinclex there?
Who cares? You’d get your BABA shares split into 3 companies   as well.
Same..... country?
I think the 6th of jan. You can double check [here](https://spactrack.net/)
No fucking clue.
Sounds good, thanks!
People that are thinking of buying BABA calls rn were the kids that stuck forks in electrical outlets when they were expressly warned not to
True at least I could burn the coal to stay warm behind the Wendy’s, baba 300c would just sit there silently judging me
nio's down like .1% lmao
Poison Ivey
Let’s see that
I'm selling today just because other opportunities.  Believe in it still.
Holy shit alibaba is fighting for its fuckin life
Ladies and Gentlemen, Merry Christmas eve and Merry Christmas.  Lets end at 1 PM on a green day.   Salute!
Let's hope for a Christmas miracle
Lol Monday morning my idiot colleague was telling how he found the perfect entry into baba and copped a bunch of shares. Sorry Steve, looks like that entry wasn’t perfect after all!
Skynet

PLTR GONNA DO IT TODAY! MY  MM DADDY JUST TOLD ME
they both have ties with the CCP
How high should this go in the next say... month? Is it a wait for a dip buy situation? Give me your retarded opinion.
🐴BIO is worth it
BABA going to 200
M-O-O-N that spells 2 cent mooning
Doesn't increasing the value of shares in these companies also increase value of these companies?
Google COVID reinfection. Why do you think there are two vaccine doses and not one? Even the CDC says it is possible to be reinfected.

Yesterday was the play. Now not so sure.
Depends on how much you got and how far out the calls are. Tbh I might not average down unless I held a leap, this could be bad for awhile.  I’m sorry bro I hope it works out for you

Today will be a 5.5 hour power hour where the market rips.  Christmas is tomorrow, which is the most bullish holiday of the year.  2021 is around the corner and all the homies are gonna want to get into their positions before that face ripper of a year starts.  Also we’re getting unlimited stimmy.  Finally, stonks have been not going up the past couple days so we gotta make up for that today.
I was joking lol
Well of course if I buy puts it will go up. If I wanted to prove my point I’d have to buy calls.
CCP making a perfect entry into Steve

Just make sure you’re buying actual shares or leap calls please. Short calls is a death trap
How the fuck would Santa not be real? I literally had sex with him in the mall bathroom 🤔

Sir, this is a Wendy’s. Not a baked potato stand.
Love Stocktwits saying "thanks for the cheap shares, shorts! Going to be buying the dip all day!" Like they have tens of millions and a 50 cent drop will make a difference.

Definitely will. Probably gonna hit 40-50 with the fomo short term
Lol it’s like when people say they buy every dip. Why are you even here if you have that kinda money lol
Merry Christmas everyone of you cucks.
SQ in talks to buy Tidal, love it
Short baba or long GME? Asking for a yolo
If you don’t need the money, just hold BABA. This will pass. BABA has a competent management and right now tensions are just high. If you don’t need it, just pretend you don’t have it. I know it hurts to look at, but look at every major dip, what is the one thing that has always happened after each dip?
I mean, fundamentally it actually is
🇺🇸 🦅
You should all in BABA
Weak
Die BABA you pos. You havent done shit for the past few months.
Rip
BuY tEh dIP!!! 🤣🤣🤣
Are you fucking dumb
That’s the risk you take. Everything is what if. If you want a huge thrill with high risk high reward, this is the chance. True WSB degens are buying baba leap calls today.
You get taxed on income, your employer also has to pay tax on your wages. You take some of you income to put in the market to make some extra cash, that gets taxed too if you make anything. You buy a house and have to pay property taxes for as long as you own it. One day you build up a nice savings and pass it on to your children/family, that’s taxed too. You can’t escape taxes.
i love u
Market closing early has no effect for me, since I usually fuck up within 5 minutes of open anyways 🤡🤡
It’s basically the same in here but somehow a little less retarded

Last chance to hop on the $GME rockship to the mooooooooooooooon

Big money isn’t betting on it. In fact, they are betting against it.   Also, Cohen doesn’t impress me and I don’t need anybody to tell me that their business model is extinct. You took take a BUS 101 class and learn that shit.

I bought LUV stock the day it was announced and currently up 70%
FNGU 260  Solid entry, it’s just taking a little nap from last weeks massive run
2/19 or 4/19 call for GME today?? Can only afford one
Been holding 300p 1/8 since the last lockup expiry. Def fucked up getting in so early, but was able to average down nicely when it spiked up to 357 on Tuesday. They needed to keep it propped up until this next lockup expiry but the gloves are coming off next week.
My guess? Baba news dragging it down
That would have made no sense. This drop in no way reflects their ability as a company. They are worth over a trillion. It’s just unlucky it’s a Chinese company.
Yes I have this going on with cruise and movie theater.
Yes
Folks hate on this stock so much here, idk why.  I got in when it was at 10.40 😎   This baby is fresh and will explode
BABA is giving one lifetime opportunity. Forget people talking about TSLA, this is the next trillion dollar company  - let China do whatever they want, they wont hurt their golden goose. Let americans sell.

Jack Ma pleas tell winnie the pooh that you're sorry
I don't get why this Alibaba thing is such a big deal, you're SUPPOSED to get monopolies, that's how you win the game 🤔
Yeah a company on the verge of obsolescence and bankruptcy should be worth much more
We're F-ed
What’s the best place to watch futures on mobile
PLTR always tank at open.
nervous rn cuz all of my holdings have been green af all week, just know something bad has to happen to me lmao
Play the BABA bounce after the weekend
username checks out
There may be enough volatility to make some money on BABA today. Yes I am autistic enough to try.
Baba is now only up 7 pct on the year ... really pissed off at the Chinese government this is so undervalued if this was in the USA
American companies gain value during anti-trust investigation, while in china , government squeeze your balls. Learn how to play market. Noobs . BABA. 😅
Markets close early today degenerates
A real gift would be not closing the markets
XLe gonna be okay?

I’m with you man
It totally sucks man.
Ok guys, I’ve been thinking and hear me out:  This short squeeze meme it’s basically imposible, let’s be honest, it’ll go up but it won’t go to the ridiculous prices of 100+ right? Seems imposible right?  But hear me out: THIS IS FUCKING 2020, THE YEAR OF IMPOSIBLES!  THINK OF ALL THE CRAZY SHIT THAT HAS HAPPENED THIS YEAR!!!!  GME 🚀 🚀 🚀
Watch people not buy this BABA dip and chase it when the investigation is over.
GAM TIME BOIS AND GURS!!!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀
Amazons chart is tighter than a nuns asshole rn, and historically January is one of their best months of the year for returns. Time to position yourself accordingly
pornhub
You're got damn right it was.
Okay does China not have a Wall Street that own a shit ton of BABA shares because it’s their bread and butter over there? Are they not pissed about all this as well?
Shares are my plan.
BABA gonna hit -20% today. Good luck to y’all ☠️
My entire account was green yesterday...took profit

Time for the weekly mental exercise of what to do if my PLTR shares get assigned
I regret buying baba calls at 270. Kill me
It's temporary. They know the game.
Not in China, being poor and losing is the only way over there.
Its complete no brainer!!!
7k Ready. Someone give me a play
At least wait until the DA.
Hands up, who’s lost money this year *raises hand*
Why is Keith Olbermann's ass posting on WSB? Ban this asshole.
Market closing early is extremely bullish - less time for people to sell. SPY 370 EOD
Make volatility great again
Not if you're just trying to repatriate the gainz.
Shut the fuck yo 🌈🐻
What’s CSP
GME TIME BOIS AND GURS!!!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀
Everyone saying buy calls on baba. I actually think that’s a bad play and this could sink more. Buy calls on JD instead in my opinion.
Dude in with you. Whats your buy at?
Didn't Jack Ma just bend the knee? Chinese aren't even playing by game of thrones rules, not cool!
sell off and reenter
That’s completely against the Hippocratic oath
I’m starting to get concerned about my 0DTE SPY 372c guys.
I dont deny their abilities but it was beaten to death so many times these past two months its not even funny. And to make it worse, it tried to go back to above 300 many times and all those attempts were eventually denied by more news.
Jesus, there cant be any more room for baba to fall right, right?
GME -3% at the open
my boy Chamath just killing it lately 😎

Yes CCP 🤐
Baba 0.5 retrace from 2018, if it hits .618 im buying
Don't jinx it man. Most of Apple's and Tesla's revenue is also coming from Gyna
Watch people buy this dip, then BABA gets delisted.
But so are you 😍

I sold a GME 1/8 18.5 CC. I guess my question is, am I retarded?
Maybe launching ANT IPO wasnt that great of an idea anyway.

I erased all my December gains
*Blocking out bad memories from Christmas Eve 2018* Yes this is correct.
Was down like 25 percent yesterday. Now I’m scared to look lmao
Xi is having his goons investigate if it's a monopoly.
Thats it caling the bottom this shit with baba, down to Jan levels, gonna eventually blow over, Xi isnt gonna let China stonks go obliviate he showed them whos the boss.  gonna buy leaps through the day.
They'lll buy the dip

What is spoo
Do you think their government cares? It's China not the US. You only become rich if the government lets you. Jack Ma has lost their good will.
If all GME playahs just set a limit sell at 100, GME would jump 10%  No borrowing against share with gtc limit sell
Google it
They were April 2021s lol. That I got a while back.   But ya..even if you had 2022 calls you’d be fucked right now.
Why are governments so obsessed with anti-trust like it’s not that serious. I apologize BABA bulls. You don’t deserve this.
PLTR
Stay away from it, as a Chinese, I m telling you, Chinese gov is not happy with Jack Ma
Yeah, I can afford to hold long term. Thinking I'll risk rather than selling at a loss. The question is will the CCP actually kill BABA? I just dont know anymore. Todays gonna hurt anyway.
Why wouldn't BABA fall more?
I made a 50/50  50% long GME (laveraged, cause Im a selfrespecting WSB member)  50% short baba. Laveraged too.

Today QS and PLTR will bring me past the moon and into mars 🚀🚀
I asked my mom if she exited BABA. She said "nope, buying the dip."  💀 help
People are just realizing that China hates it’s people lol.
I’d scoop both if I could. Currently only holding calls.

It’s different as CCP has history of no accountability
Fuck is up with nio PM
 i stg if this fucker on cnbc doesn't mute his computer i'm gonna lose it
All the governments want a cut of big tech. It's looking like it will be a confiscation tax of sorts going forward. Luckily they can all afford it. But FUCK the government for demanding a cut.
ICLN and ARK are safe bets. But if you wanna make some money, check out $LMND. When you don't want to FOMO, check out $EVER
Can't the stock market just outsource all of these holidays to India?
No, they won’t allow BABA to fail. It’s the closet thing to AMZN they have, and China wouldn’t give up such a huge foothold to international markets for whatever is going on...it would be an irrational decision. You do you, but BABA is a solid company, especially if you don’t care to hold for years. I wouldn’t average in (at least not now), but no point selling at a loss
Yeah I have been able to!
If the threat of being delisted in America didn't do much to it, it should be fine over this BABA thing. It does make me reconsider investing in Chinese companies, though. As if there wasn't reason enough already.
I guess she gonna go -50% EoY
Jan 1st
Am i done trying to catch the falling knife?   Nope lol
GME puts bought to print
maybe im dumb, but isnt that just going to fill at open regardless of if you cancel it?
where is the check   ?

Anybody watch Your Moms House Podcast?  Nadav said he’s “really into stocks” aka he spends all day on WSB
Damn thought canoo was gonna go green
P T N is a 10 bagger guys jump on before it gets back to where is was 100$ + and before it starts hitting headlines. Happy holidays
i got 2023 apple calls and got fucked it tanked 40% but i just waited 2 months and they are up 20% now, dumped a bunch and bought all these spacs and went up even more, leaps cost a bit more but so worth it. but with this BABA shit you dont even know what they are doing in china its scarier
Because if you buy from AMZN you actually are just buying from BABA.
Oh look another wsb knock off sub
It’s all Xi
IMAX theaters were the best.
I do have a friend on this sub that sold a week ago and lost his ass.  At 18.5 I’ll be making a tiny profit at least. Maybe I’ll luck out though...
This is most likely
Wtf happen to steel?
Definitely gonna buy baba at the open...just not sure about shares or options
BABA puts at open. Xi is on your side. Can’t fail.
60k. Are you dumb? How much thinking did that take
Is she single?
Haven’t heard any news that he did.
We have AMZN
BABAs going down not where I would've put it but I'm no psychic, could pull a fast one and surge to the moon.
Yo what if Xi and Jack are Lowkey best friends and they just shaking out all American paper hands so they can get cheaper shares before BABA literally sells the Chinese every item ever.
i might buy BABA though after that long speech. if i get it at 200$ ill go in for sure
broken up companies are often worth more than the sum of their parts, BABA will survive
Where?
His company 😂
Nah, go for it. Just finance and drop the rest on tsla leaps. Pays for itself!

STIC STIC STIC
Do we think the market sells off at open?
My two cents on BABA and you can buy/sell/wank whatever with it.  What makes you think someone like the CPP who doesn’t give a fuck about violating global human rights laws, has thousands of fraudulent companies using US patents, and promotes mass censorship gives a flying fuck about a company like Alibaba being successful if their CEO forgets what hood he’s in.  What we’re going to see is a literal example being made of Jack Ma. They’re going to ensure that future CEOs of companies like JD or NIO won’t forget who’s really in charge, or so help them God, the CCP will make sure their companies fail and they’ll lose some non-vital organs to boot.  Fuck Xi, fuck the CCP, fuck their dictatorship, all in NIO leaps
Warrants or shares at this point?
I mean if she's buying shares not FD's it's probably ok

I’m sure you could do that on your own time with your own money instead of the cheap or free vaccine but when it comes down to it, it’s only for your peace of mind and not necessary. I’m 100% sure there are antibody test studies ongoing, but why would they recommend everyone get one? Or whatever OP is implying by hearing about them more? It’s unnecessary.
I don't own jd anymore but shouldn't JD profit from this (if this was a rational market). I am confused as to why they are bleeding too.
Once again. I’m holding 50 fucking 2 dollar He Xo 1/15 calls. After the reverse split, its trading around 4. Why are these still worthless?   I’m obviously too hungover to Google and already wrote off the 500 dollar loss, I’m just curious.

Anybody cash out their BABA puts yesterday?  how ya feeling?
This profit taken is an ancient art
Warrants are currently trading at a discount, but it stays that way as SPACs moon. Just make a decision and buy a ton. I have a ton of both, planning on adding warrants on every dip
Has GME changed their business model at all? Just curious
Jack Ma has to feel so emasculated rn. Imagine being that rich but powerless.

What do u mean?
Don’t really give a shit about BABA but for anyone w/ NIO just chill out. This has nothing whatsoever to do with them and every single thing China-related right now is just taking a premarket hit.
Edibles are the way. You don't feel as bad and you eat more.
Cool go get an antibody test with your own money then. It’s for your peace of mind and unnecessary. Vaccine will be free or cheap and an antibody test is for your peace of mind only. I’m sure they are doing studies but that doesn’t make the vaccine any less important

Best of luck
Reverse splits are bad. Usually show that a company isn’t doing well.

Not wheeling the naked puts. Using naked puts to get assigned the position and then start wheeling. I'll just keep selling naked puts until it pulls back, I get assigned, then use those shares to start wheeling.

This year has taught me to stop doubting my vibe, called the rises of GRWG, QS, FUBO, ICLN and few others and also timed PLTR's top. Only problem is I'm too retarded to hold (except ICLN). I've dodged out of market dips pretty well and my worst play was FOMO'ing into TSLA this past Monday. Gonna try to to keep listening to myself and hold. MCFE 1/15 $20c
baba poohts are free money
It won’t be better by February
I hope GME moons for you guys but if it can drill and go negative at open like yesterday so I can unload these 21p's that'd be nice

My deepest apologies
They call it XL for the size of the bags it gives you 💰

I say we declare war on China, everyone buy some fake knockoff shit from eBay right now, the money will be funneled into BABA to fight back against the CCP!
They said the same last month. Didnt turnout better for them.
Not good, ty for asking!
Serious baba tanks
Plus a double bottom would of already occurred
It is in China. With the BABA/ANT shenanigans the CCP is just proving once again that you really can't trust chinese stocks.
😍
That's because steel gang (MT, VALE, FCX etc) has entered the cryo chambers and are going to wake up in 3 months for some sick gains.
what stocks are on your watchlist for today?
Please don’t weak hand bft and sell before Christmas the gains are going to be 2x bagger type shit
 Who bought baba puts? Bc my dumbass sure didn’t
GME 25+ TODAY
Those that missed Ocugen look up Dynavax and Tonix Pharma.  That's my covid Christmas miracle trio.
1 for the retard and 2 for the autist

It’s actually a great company that won back its rights to a drug. Just helping people make a few bucks I have been saying buy it for a few days.   Also, a penny stock is just a company with a low market cap. People don’t understand this.
Thanks Jack Ma for the Christmas present. Love waking up to this.
They all went long on rope last night
I cut the cord a while ago in terms of cable. Am watching CNBC while visiting my family and some of these guests they have on are pretty bad.
Is NIO gonna get green or another shit day ahead ?
I'd like a drill just to load up on shares. Stoploss triggered when I didn't watch closely. Still 40% gains, non taxesmd in belgium

No Job report today?
CLDR TO 25 TODAY
So cash secured puts
I actually have 15 call positions I bought when it was trading at $14. I want to be wrong.
Look to what happened with Facebook when they threatened breaking it up for example. Typically people have short term memory but there should be plenty of examples to see

Hedge funds and institutions have discovered wsb
Shit due to BABA news, all China stocks will dump
That’s what I been saying. People here are fucking retarded and keep saying “that’s why I don’t fuck with Chinese stocks”.
Huawei got fucked on a global scale for 5g networks and phones etc.
Bags on bags here and hasn’t moved
Never. Get in now or forever regret it.
🐴BIO
There was some demented autist here who had predicted BABA would hit $220 a month back and I had laughed at him.
Dude sentiment with baba right now is very negative I would not buy it. A lot of big money put buying over the last couple weeks. But Im retarded so
No
even hedge funds are GUHing right now. Bridgewate, 3rd point etc all have BABA bags.
Your wife asks this everytime you solicit her for sex

BABA excellent buy at these levels. It’s not going anywhere

I’m watching my download speed on Xbox and it I’m getting the same neural nets triggered when watching a stock price. Fuck all of you.
Look out we have a badass over here
Funny how rapidly sentiment changes. When BABA was flying at 300/share in anticipation for the ANT ipo, it was an amazing buy, great fundamentals, going to be the Chinese amazon and rocket.   Now that it’s sitting at being almost negative YTD and down 30% from its top, it’s a shit Chinese scam stock and will bankrupt you, even if you go long
How stupid are my WFC leaps
Not a guh till we sell

It's funny, USA or EU launch antitrust or monopoly shit at AMZN, APPLE, FB, GOOG and they falter 1-2% on a bad day..       BABA gets in the cross hairs and gets fucking mutilated.
If u wanna buy baba don't buy right away I feel this shit may tank more after a small bounce
Actually all the cheap shit people bought of AMZN came from BABA. She’ll be back.
Just because Ma insulted everyone over there. Literally wouldve been fine if he hadnt started getting full of himself
Fucking pls

Trump has not signed the bill. He might pocket veto it (aka not sign it by Monday, letting it expire) to pressure McConnell to pass 2k stimulus check.
Who knew the Backstreet Boys were singing about the stock market?  **BABA-BYE**
There's some Chinese American guy reading this and there's some Chinese equivalent to twitter where he follows Xi Jinping and he's making bank going along with Xi doing insider trading based on Xi's subtle telegraphing of his upcoming moves. This week is gonna be a solid 40-bagger for the man I'm speaking of but he won't share any of it with us. He's not telling us about this Chinese Twitter equivalent and giving us translations of little things Xi says. Why not? I ask you, mysterious Chinese lurker, why do you selfishly lurk and refuse to participate? I would give you my retarded advice if I thought it could help you, why won't you give us yours?
“We’re still working in it, maybe we’ll do something about it eventually idk lol”
It’s going to 220
Unless of course China continues this path and breaks them up
Everyone knows the unemployed are working as Santa's Elves for the season. No need for them this week.

Good morning, OPEN!  Please don’t gape me today 🥺
This Christmas feels different
Inverse WSB. Same idiots who would downvote you in April for saying you were buying calls.
Lol no
Good dip coming up for NIO for that parabolic run next week
i mean youre right but not in this case.  we originally thought it was a quick tussle with XI but its clearly more serious than that. or the market thoguht jack ma would make things right with the CCP in the name of good business but he hasnt done that.
Happy Nochebuena to the Hispanic ones around here 🎄🎁✨
I don’t pay attention very well but they have good prices on Arizona tea
And ours tbh
Fellas, my gf just consulted her astrology chart and she says it’s a good day to buy. “Just don’t buy from 8-9pm”  My play: BABA
Fuck NIO really got hit by the BABA bs?  Come on man
I agree, but even the slightest possibility of spillover is giving me a headache.
This song goes out to all the BABA call holders.   Love is a burning thing And it makes a fiery ring Bound by wild desire I fell into a ring of fire I fell into a burning ring of fire I went down, down, down and the flames went higher And it burns, burns, burns, the ring of fire The ring of fire
Correct. It's something to trade with a stop loss for sure

cause you know that the worst there gonna get in the u.s or eu is a slap on the wrist not get lined up behind a pf changs and get added to the weekend special
🤡
Sorry to those who bought baba calls yesterday. I was very tempted after recovering at my support buy level of $252.70s but glad I didn’t hold them over night
That literally tells you nothing important
Became capitalist.
Stimulus on hold and premarket slightly green.  Gonna wait to see if it dumps at open first.
Facts
3-&gt;20 was Cohen and r/wsb, the squeeze hasn't even started yet. That will take this fucking thing to the moon. 🚀🚀🚀🚀  150 or nothing!
Exactly, whatever price you buy at today will be a discount a year from now
Slippery slope to Fox News with that comment lol
Ha Ya I’m cutting my losses before they turn to -80 percent.   Just gonna roll them into Apple and fb leaps.
So everybody dump NIO and pump Canoo please

Good luck
You're thinking about N'Sync I believe.
At the worst it’s back to 25 but not likely.  Just buy
Eh.....not really. BSB was and still is fire.
I bought 656c at 622 yesterday and hit a nice little 5 bagger
Are baba leaps the play now??
Holy mother of Jesus is got much worse for baba...-10% now. Open is gonna be a fucking massive sell off
So focused on GME, forgot I also have a ton of steel plays next year.
That’s gonna be a rough average down.
💩
Love it
I understand that. I’m actually really curious to see how drastically this changes in an hour and 5

Fuckin pltr. 29 forever huh ?
AI... Alibaba Intelligence
Just calculate it yourself on smartasset
Baba, and all other businesses in China, exist only as long as the whims of the entirely unaccountable government allow them to. In America the megacaps own the government. In China it is the exact opposite.
BABA 300 EOD from China Street pumping the fuck out of this.
One of those is more likely to be true than the other... just saying.

Not a bad idea. ICLN is about to correct probably 10ish%. You can hop back in

It was released yesterday.
Nice reply
Should I hop into GME at open?
Nio only down less than a point.  Hahaha..  that's a good sign
Just regular income tax on it
Oh wow, I just saw. How do you not get some BABA here? Cheap suits! Cheap suits!
That's cause the fine or slap from China is real vs only pocket money for Usa cos
Time to go smoke a burner and sip my cup of Joe outside before I get some Christmas tendies...Merry Christmas Comrads
YOLOd BABA at the end of October and have been averaging down since then 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
BRPA went from $11 to $70 this week. It's back around $30 now. I might buy in if it dips lower. They are merging with a company that has a successful covid therapeutic that may get emergency use authorization in the next 3 weeks.
lol. Wtf. Why is all the PM at 0%?
They bought back intels stake in them
I mean to be fair, that mall was busy enough that even a guy from CNBC was there. Legitimately noteworthy
It was out yesterday, were you in a coma?
Penny stocks are shares traded under 5 bucks with a low market cap. You're thinking of just a small cap stock. Commonly misunderstood
Ok so the GME short squeeze is real. Has anyone considered what might happen afterwards? I mean, GME is still a piece of shit. What's actually gonna happen when the squeeze is over?
Trump said the bill contains too much wasteful spending, and the wasteful spending should be given to the American people instead, which is why he recommends $2000 instead of 600. The bureaucrats take that as, $2000,+$600, +the wasteful spending. Insanity. They’ve been pulling shit like that since Nixon was president, and Milton Friedman proposed the negative income tax... TO REPLACE welfare. What ends up happening, congress votes to add a negative income tax to all the existing welfare, and the support fell apart. Guess what’s going to happen with this stimulus? Same shit.
You are a fucking tard if you buy Baba at open
I am
GME squeeze time
The best set up. No splitting time or families getting jealous. Get yourselves a Latin lover boys lol
I vote bullish on low volume
I will literally be so happy when GME dies  Just so I don’t have to see the letters GME between every 5 fucking words that I read on here
Let’s go
Plus a half day and markets closed tommorow. Clown car effect?
I’m worried about that too
I recommend playing World War Z. Got it on Game Pass last night
At least I’ll have some loss porn for you boys

That's not bad bruh. It's up pre-market - what do you think?  In anything else?
Gme went from 3$ to 20$ I don’t think a squeeze is in play retards just playing musical chair 🪑 at this point
If Mr. Ma becomes a US citizen, he will lose the Chinese. I don't think any Chinese company should go public,  just opens a can of worms.

BABA dec jan feb calls all going -99% GUH
Damn the bugs are really pissed at alien head man
This baba sell off is a gift to long term holders tho
drops back down. what else lol
No. Wait until support establishes
Psth, qell, snpr
Coz the CCP is more powerful in China than the US govt is in the US
This would be down 3-4 points premarket if that was the case.
Holy fuck. Thank god i stopped playing baba
Lol yea I'm gtfo if theres any sort of xl type omentum. This ones a good long play though imo
Go drink some Eggnog and Baileys from a boot you degenerates
Depends on your tax bracket could be anywhere from 28% to 40%
any link to live stream of congress session starting in 2min?
Christmas miracle today boys and girls. Green all around. Lord save me
If we get pinned under $22 today with GME, I hope everyone goes all in on FDs. This thing bout to blast off
I thought the same thing around 255. Surely it couldn't go below 255.  &lt;Narrator: It went well below 255&gt;
I mean I’m the one with 10k loss porn posted so no 😂

His point is that you can’t be assigned with naked puts- you don’t have the cash to buy the shares by definition. You probably mean cash secured puts?
He gave a speech critical of Chinese government regulators and banks. So they fucking ruined him
Let’s be clear the Republicans are saying it’s wasteful.  Trump may as well have kicked them in the nuts.  If they tank the bill now they’re probably not going to win the senate in Georgia.
I have $100 on Webull that I completely forgot about because I don’t use the app. What calls should I buy with it?
It drops sharply back down to support. I don’t see it going back below $18 after the real squeeze though.

Damn rip Baba
PLTR cucking begins
Gyna ate your lunch
IMO, wouldn't buy calls for anything until next week or the new year, could be a lot more profit taking/rebalancing.  Remember that massive selloff of Dec 2018?
Regular income tax. With deduction and shit, the effective rate should be around 20% so 20k-25k
Turn on the printers bois
Oh shoot I bought LGVW with that 100 when I opened the account, might as well just turn that into calls once they’re available 🤷‍♂️
You must hate pltr then
Normally the stock dumps. Look at ostk 1 year chart
200.
Going all in on T calls because I'm retarded
Ah I gotcha. It's a CSP, I just wasn't thinking
apparently not I just got murdered for suggesting this
srne* but yeah i may sell soon
Underrated comment
Stic
Baba. The only stock actually undervalued based on fundamentals and look what is happening to it. Stocks with no fundamentals (hello QS) to the moon. This market 🤡
I’m afraid it’ll be another situation like Luckin Coffee earlier this year where it went up to around $50 quickly then fall to almost nothing even faster after an a similar antitrust allegation
I’m a man of the people. In conclusion, BABA 300 EOD
Haha awesome brother. Made me smile especially bc I'm going to be spending Christmas alone.... cheers from SE Michigan.
GME please go above 22
LOL, you know you can lookup how many shares are shorted right?
Went there yesterday. Current business model is terrible and they are more expensive than competitors locally. If it “squeezes” it will go back to penny stock eventually. Shit company
Are Baba calls the move?
Be successful
502 boi
BRB, my other gf knows more about dream interpretation than gf 1...
The CCP ain’t the DOJ dawg. The CCP is made up of competing families who want a piece of Jack’s pie. I’m not touching Baba for a while.
All BABA calls just became FD's expiring today
BSBR is up 80% last 3 months - so calls on BSBR?
He is probably so hard rn
The spending is wasteful, billions of dollars go to other countries. 900B to send out $600 checks which cost 200b. So where’s the other $2400?
So let me interpret this.  If your sole income was the $100k then you would pay the 28%, correct?  If in conjunction to the $100k you also have a high net worth job, then we are looking at the 40%...
Wait for it to stabilize. Dont buy a leap on a huge down day, IV is going to be high as fuck
I’m waiting for that shit to DUMP at open
NOBODY MOVE!
They’re not going to do shit  I have 12 shades of baba at 283 so I’m kind of hoping the blood bath ends lol
Will spy get to 370 today?
I’m glad you unAmerican traitors are getting burned rn, this is WallStreetBets, not GreatWallBets 😤
If you told me 6 months ago that the Russell 2000 would end up being a better trade than Chadsdaq I would have laughed.
BUY NGA IF U LIKE MONEY  FCEL TOO
Lol. GME actually went up. Still if you gave me $100, I'd put it in a penny stock.
Thankfully I'm already down 50% on my BABA position. Can't go down that much more!
Sell all your positions that are down money to offset your gains
hey, my gf said the same thing...
Yeah, the efficient market holds true
I just told my boomer uncle   To go fuck himself for telling me to put my   Money in a index fund and retire care free at 65 years of age  “ WHY ARE THESE FUCKERS CONFIDENT THEY WILL LIVE THAT LONG”   The fuck unless Cathy ark is right about Genome edit therapy. Bitch 40 years of age is the peak before it goes DOWN hill   And cock need pill 💊 to work

Open the fucking market. I need to put a load in FLIR. 🚀 $50
BABA puts at open?
I’ll buy BABA if it gets close to $200
Proof?
Looks like BABA is catching some bids around 230
My bet is a $20.50 open on GME.
Hurry! I haven't ever sent her any bear memes it's gotta mean something!
Just curious, what is your basis for this position?  There are plenty of other stocks with similar gains, are they all musicals chairs?
Yea, I know! Buying ROPE atm
Can anyone make a bull case ? Or explain flatness over months ? Maybe I’ll hold through next ER....
Why are we open on Christmas Eve, its not like im getting anything done today.
Maybe... and probably. But you could say something similar about any time of year.

i bought shares the calls seemed exp, but i woulda made more on the calls lol
It’s actually not as bad. Pltr has a legitimate argument as a company. The only reason these morons keep parroting GME is because some guy is telling them this mythical short squeeze will happen. There is 0 value in the underlying stock, it’s just a technical play that I would guess maybe 1% of the people saying “GME GME GME 🚀🚀🚀🚀” even understand
🐴BIO $5 June ‘21 calls
I believe the stock will bounce after the weekend after all this noise going into the holiday
Too low pt
Baba is the backbone of Chinese companies finding buyers for their junk...  Hurting baba would just destroy Chinese exports  Hence this is just posturing by the bug people
The bill is omnibus spending bill, not a Covid bill. If even has tax write-offs for corporate lunches that Trump wanted in there. They’re making excuses and sabotaging the economy to fuck with Dems. That’s republicans for you. Also $2 billion extra to add to the Space Force lol
*down 70% eod*
Yes lets buy leaps when IV is high as fuck
Don’t play BABA. You’re welcome.
that was from fed hiking interest rates
Look at KODK or OSTK.
Thank you for the Made in China gifts
Setting a BABA buy limit at $219.99. Steal at that price.
Now that my calls have expired, yes
BEHOLD - THE DUALITY OF MAN  IN ONE CORNER, WE HAVE THE PEOPLE PANIC SELLING THEIR BABA CALLS  IN THE OTHER CORNER, WE HAVE PEOPLE OPENING NEW BABA POSITIONS  **NEXT WEEK THE SAME PEOPLE BUYING BABA CALLS TODAY WILL BE SELLING THEM TO NEW DIP BUYERS WHEN BABA HITS 200**

This BABA situation is not as straightforward.  BABA is not an american company where the courts function properly. IF the communist party has a bone to pick with BABA they WILL get their pound of flesh.  All comes down to behind closed door dick sucking happening right now.  The nightmare scenario will be if Xi does to BABA what putin has done to many Oligarchs he disapproved of in Russia...
👌🤤

It's a bit boring, but it is easy and pretty safe money.  Just seldom get explosive gains.

The CCP is going to keep pushing Baba down to like $175, load up on OTM Calls Expiring 0dte and then fucking publicly hug Jack Ma and say all is good. Baba $350 eoy.
LKNCY 2.0 ?
My mom likes to forward me the investment articles she gets from her big bank financial advisor. It's almost always something WSB has been pumping for a couple days that has already run up 20%. What a business.
when u nut but she keeps sucking HNNNGGG
The way you say Canadian women like it's a category of porn I respect
Dude I’m a 19 year old fat kid from North Korea 🇰🇵
I have a hard time believing anyone in this sub knows the metrics of what is actually going on over there, myself included. Risky business messing with China... riskier business messing with China when headlines are involved.
I’m going to Parler to talk shit about my Chyna calls getting clapped FUK
Co worker got corona the other day. I get to spend Christmas alone!! Woo hooo
When should I cover the short I made on Tesla last Monday?
Why is nobody upvoting me 😔
They could buy Ford with cash.
Gud luck with that
Citron believes it’s gonna pump more than qs and lazr combined so let’s see
RIP BABA
Damn straight I just sold whatever I had yesterday. Been waiting on the launch pad too long.  Watch it fly now.....
DBX quietly grind its way to 30
There is almost no action in premarket today.  I can't even get quotes on many tickers.
Let him do that and show him up in a lambo after a few years of autism with us
Puts open?
Nothing good is in Florida
All I want for Christmas issssss one of the many options to at least print so I can make another play to obsess overrrr so when my ADHD kicks in at the dinner table I can think of some new shit instead of these old options I’ve been holding for a week now reminding me that I’m not only all in this bitch but these stocks all in this bitch and it should be a silent tradition to grant tendies on Christmas Eve btw it’s a short day like fuck just break up with me why don’t you anyway work is trash so I’ve just been auto writing and I think I’ve gone long enough to say PERIOD
Wish I knew where the 80 billion in market cap from Baba is going. It can’t just be sitting out this weekend....
Baba bagholders learn the costs of dealing with the Chinese
[removed]
Dat BABA dip tho
Yeah I've been doing vertical spreads, butterflies, and ICs for a minute now. I've grown my account to a big enough size where I'm comfortable holding 100 shares of something
CLDR ripping early today
is salesforce a buy at this price?
Lol this is a monopoly investigation not fraud
$baba leaps
Time to sell
BABA is making sure you have something to hang on the christmas tree
DAMN Futures just broke out on volume !
Solid DD, bro.
Well they should actually
Xl just went -7 to +7 loool
Well, ultimately the government has to perform its function as a social safety net. Which means taxes are redistributive in nature. That’s why they’re percent driven and progressive. The more you received from society, the more you have, and the more you will give back to keep society running.
You have no self confidence, my big dick comment will get tons of upvotes
I was pretty upset about buying WMT calls right before the opioid rumor lawsuit but now I’m just thankful I sold my BABA calls for a profit last week. A true Christmas miracle
Shares guy here and I’m feeling sick to stomach
NGGA please
You probably meant to say “expired worthless”
Definitely not. Zero appeal there. Why pair up with a shitty auto manufacturer when there are plenty of others that are more tech savvy and ahead of the curve
third point with 2.5mil shares of BABA just went GUH
Get rich like babababiden
BABA is turning my christmas hellish
GME SHORT SQUEEZE DRAWS CLOSER. WE WILL MAKE HISTORY
No buying for me today - just going to enjoy the Christmas price boost.
Only complete scum are sitting at their comp right now waiting for open...
Can tech has one nice Green Day for old times sake
Get on the SRAC train!!
Directly into Xi’s pockets
you fuckers still have time to jump on the ARK, we need 2 of every retard
S&amp;P 500
Yessir
Better start averaging down that price boy lol
GME LETS GO
Shares maybe although CRMs are getting fragmented IMO  They do own slack, heroku and some other stuff though
Yea question is how far does it fall before it’s at a “buy”
XL stahpppp. Let me get some more before you rocket again
Holy shit oc.gn had 900million trades yesterday. If it dips below 2 today im loading up
Man I hope not. Have 14 contracts expiring today 😂 most are very in the money but a few aren’t
What the hell INO
Gme calls
bought the dip half an hour ago up 10%. Lord XL
I’m from the future, GME will reach $1000 today 🌚
If GME hits 25 by EOY I will chug a coconut LaCroix
CALLS OR SHARES?
XL yesssss fly!!!!
https://indianexpress.com/article/india/covaxin-triggered-immune-responses-no-serious-adverse-events-bharat-biotech-7117584/
Possibly one average down, but man it’s so hard to tell.  I wouldn’t do it more than once though
You should change your handle to youngmillionair now  Lol.
Username is on point
Waiting for the pull back next week.
ADHD doesn’t exist, some bullshit psychological metric so that big pharmas and psychiatrists can stay in business.
Why is nobody downvoting me😔
Wallstreet is definitely reading sir jack a lot's wsb dd
He's part of the CCP
Just love seeing my account slowly vanish before my eyes
It’ll moon now, thanks
Trading wmt Is so painful
Honestly who is running things at apple? Really? No EV till 2024? Do you have any idea how far ahead Tesla would be by then? Semi, roadster, Y and cypertruck would of flooded the market by then
Volume about to be low as duck today?
Good combo
Every news agency biases their view point and adds flavor to what someone said. Politics and news is toxic.
Imagine not having a position. In GH.IV right now.
Lol to be fair there are good advisors out there.  Several member-only websites employ a team to just dig into companies all day and put out a recommendation only when they find something; quality not quantity
So what see in the mean time is adding more apple products into Ford vehicles. Using Ford factories take some make them ev factories also.
50 shades of Baba
Magic Karp lay golden eggs , so what does that say about Alex Karp! PLTR 🚀🚀🚀🌕🥚
Best time to buy a leap is when a stock has been trading sideways for a bit. Even if i was going to buy one today i would wait until 12
Haven’t there been something like 20,000 “new strain / mutations” so far?
Good morning all, I am at work alone. How great, I could leave and nobody would find out probably. Anyways I won't be doing that because its time FOR GOOD TIMES at Morongo Casino Resort.  &amp;#x200B;  Wait this is W$B.....eh same thing i guess
Definitely, you know what they say, "buy the news"
I’m probably gonna lose 2k on BABA for Christmas 🤷‍♂️
I luv being all in GME
I was up big on that bounce a few weeks ago.. ended up selling when it came down and I was even.. thank god I did. I had 30k in calls.
But men falling ok their own sword  They will cut their exports in half if they hurt alibaba
If you don’t FOMO 🐝, you ain’t homo
At least
Yeah my personal take is that this is the most likely scenario. MA's just gotta suck some dick and get in line. I think Xi will use this more as a warning to other companies to get in line and know whose the boss.   Nightmare scenario is if Xi does to BABA what Putin has done to oligarchs he didn't like essentially forcing them to give up their businesses
 Melvin capital a bunch of sad cucks
yes
Link
Also yes
My first time buying 4 hour FDs wish me luck
Yes but from someone that has been in since the WORK acquisition, be prepared for a very slow and frustrating path to gains. When I say this shit moves *slow*...
🔝😈 no fear
open a SPY chart we were 368.19 on Dec 4 and barely 2% above or below that this entire month. were 368.11 now. thetagang won.
Energy companies are getting bumped by the COVID relief bill.  Assuming it passes.
What happen to it? Any news?
I need tendies
Yes, if you plan to hold for longer than 10 days.
Cathie thinks so
Alright BABA shareholders - are we selling at open?
Tsa travellers 1m Everyday... nobody cares about corona
Probably not that good of a day to trade lol
Anyone else holding TSLA or QS calls? Gimme your projections for today and next week!
Nonsense.
Congrats theta gang. Not buying anything till last 5 mins of day. Then all in on puts for the rug pull next Monday.
buy the BABA dip, that is all
boys eriously. get in to XL.  1 thing about SPACs is that there is too many. Citron basically did the DD from all the EV SPACs and said XL is a winner. its going to Valhalla.
GME making me nut everyday I love it
Then go to wendys
i laughed, and i cried.
lol where is the guy who bought BABA calls yesterday
PLTR with that 9 am red dildo as is tradition. Next up - anotha one at 9:30.
depends which duck
XL FLYING!
Gme model is out daded a blast from the soon to be past if you will reminds me of Block buster
YEAH 👊👊😃😃😏💊
Lol yup wtf
Hella bullish on GME but could see some profit taking after huge bull run and before xmas. I expect next week to be great though
Slowly? Ur doing it wrong
Goddam qs 1 month chart
I trusted you China! You dishonour my family this Christmas.
Last week I sold me TSLA calls Friday afternoon, at close it jumped like $50. Is that gonna happen again? Should I buy some $690-700 lottos at open?
Imagine thinking a $2t company was limited in what it could do. Please
Smiling and laughing with the Family at christmas while crying deep down about my BABA Position.
Someone on here randomly said they don't fuck with Chinese companies. I wish I could thank him - kept me away from BABA
The government acting as a social safety net is a huge hindrance to the economy, throughout most of our countries history you relied on your family, and community for support in hard times. If you believe society has the obligation to help others, they should do it directly, not by using the government to take other people’s money to pay for it.
When U/DEEPFUCKINGVALUE is out, everyone should be out.
I reappy dont knlw at this point, I have shares from 280...
I bought one XL 1/15/21 $25c at $7.00. It ain’t much, but it’s mine.
Ok good suggestion
Saw this. Of course more vaccines the better but is it going to be too little to late?
Absolutely. Both shares and leap calls are looking really good for CRM.
Sell if you have a “fuck China” mentality which is fair after this fiasco. Hold if you understand that your emotions in the market are temporary.
XL is pumping like a madman on christmas week with no volume. once ppl get back from holiday this is going past 50 easily.
$SBE 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀👨‍🚀
If GME somehow makes it to $25 today I’ll buy a new boat.
BABA pleas fly again! Don’t fall like Luckin Coffee did before
Why didn't I get XL 30c when they were $450
which way will AAPL shoot today. Probably down right?
Next Stop: Moon
Time to short PLTR
well that what i was doing and in 10k loss. stfu
If this doesn't pan out, I feel like there'll be a lot of people calling for his blood over a pump-and-dump.
What’s the merger they are working on?
The PR team sucks and theres no big firm giving it a price target. Itll trade flat until that happens
Yes everybody please do!!
Sold tsla last week to buy baba calls.  I'm sorry Papa Elon. I'll never bet against you and America again.
Yes read their latest earnings statement - right direction financially as well as operationally which will support / increase their bottom line. Although they’re well poised to execute their financial improvement initiatives (favorable working capital, removing redundancies in store, SG&amp;A, etc) the question still remains how successful they’ll be in their transition into e-commerce vs giants such as steam and not to mention potential competitors coming into the market (far stretch but perhaps Amazon or other international players)
Set a limit buy at $20 until cancelled and just wait for it to trigger... Probably won't ever happen, but if something goes horribly wrong at PLTR, you'll be able to find out quickly.
With such little volume today, this sub could actually control the market   I’m guessing GME and PLTR
It would become the best vaccine out there if true.
palantir fuck meeeeee
Thats what im saying. Got it at 10.50, may hold post merger for that dividend and go full boomer
I got 6 x 29$ weeklys for .04 a contract. YOLO
I thought Brexit was getting announced overnight?
Is that a real flavor?! Thought limoncello was the bottom of the barrel
My "please fly again" message must have not gotten through
Only 3.5 hours of trading. I feel cheated.
If you're gonna burn money, do it with $HYLN calls
The very first time I read the phrase "sTonKs onLy Go uP" I though the top was surely in.   If I had just believed it and bought leap calls on almost anything, I'd be a very rich man.   At least from then until now, the stonks did indeed only go up.
Google helps a lot.  They lay out the bill and it’s spending.  PPP, extra unemployment, State aid, farmers, and wierd pork spending shit.  Yeah some of that shit is wasteful, but consider the alternative of not passing it.
He's made her plenty of money over the S&amp;P. I just find it funny every time I get the email. Today it was MGNI.
ALL IN GME
Congrats
MGM and DKNG just put in a 2 billion dollar offer for WSB
25 dollars down on baba. Ill still wait till after buden in to enter
Yes
that’s because you don’t know how to play this game m8
BABA bagholders, just go all in on PLTR before it rips to 30 and beyond 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Sometimes before the markets are open, I sit here refreshing the page on my account, but I can't believe how much money I've made in the last 30 days.
Please don’t sell off please don’t sell off please don’t sell off
You mean you haven’t had sex covered in maple syrup? You ain’t living life bro.
Cause your cock wasn’t XL like mine
Buy baba 0dte strangles at open
When that cash gang feels hit
$NGA = NEXT XL FLEET
**FLY FNGU FLY**
Currently own baba shares, should i uhhhh, buy more?
No
Does anyone know the HR manager here. My clock in username won’t work. However, good morning dumbasses.
I told you guys XL would rip. There’s still time to get in before 60
they could buy it with an apple watch and some kfconsole tendies
I bought shares after bug jump yesterday and they already plus 20%. Bad i have only 3
Market close at 1 today?
Serious question. I lucked out and yolo’d into tn xp yesterday and it’s up big in after hours. Sell at open or ride it out?
🐴BIO and you boys can make enough money to fund your hedge bets on Chinese stocks from now until 2030.
The alternative of not passing it is to open up and do what we’ve been doing since 1776. It’s been working fine so far.
GME word word word word word GME word word word word word GME
*butt chug
It tastes like suntan lotion
Im gonna deposit $5k and use the instant deposit to average down, use a day trade and cancel the deposit  Hacking the system
ok time to get XL, I can sense this has same autist strength as QS
Yikes
I personally liked his other picks more. This one feels like something I would buy only to sell vendors the merger. If looy box couldn't make it, not sure bark vox can but tendies so yeah
Goddamn qs 1 month chart
I got them at 1.15
Same. Do not buy this dip
0dte xl puts?
Someone explain why people are bullish about GME
Merry Spacmas!
SHINY AND CHROME
Anyone thinking of buying Toshiba cuz they’re rumored to be supplying icar batteries?
Yes. Lock in profits and rotate

Only thing I’ll be holding is my cock while I watch GME moon
Today • I am dealing myself the best winning hand in this daily game of Poker•  Pray it to existence-  ACB TSLA Put some more on the list guys! Group think this bad boy to Tsla $750 today  Best wishes Merry Christmas  Let every human have a happy holiday.  •When it comes down to it, it is US against the lizard people•
I need DKNG to 60 by EOD 🥲
wheres the bro who told me "big things are coming for PLTR" yesterday.
NGL OR XL RN????
Why is LOOP alive still?  I’m starting to wonder if it’s Hindenburg research who are the scammers
Bear market by open.
The weak point is Citron in this equation. Opened small positions for quick gains anyway
I could care less if the company died. I’m holding 2 dollars calls and the underlying is currently 4.39.   What is this new devilry.
[removed]
in this market? its going past that likely.
LETS GO GMEEEEEEE if I hit 800% today I’m selling.
Ew
Tim Apple is a dipshit
BABA getting LK’d
Bruh at this point if you don't know then just move on
If GME hits 23 in the first hour of trading it will save christmas
It’s funny
lol y’all know what happens, market opens and every ticker goes red just like usual
Baba 190 eod
Fk u
🙏🚀
Dear SPY,   if you could hit 370 again today I would make good money. If you would hit 369, I would make a little money. If you would stay above 368 I wouldn't lose too much money.   If you go below that, I'm going to be very disappointed and personally offended.
today’s a good day to take profit on shorter exp calls and buy shares and leaps for next quarter
Nobody tell him
The issue is that this will be dead money for who knows how long? Could be a year before this rebounds
Yep, no one is buying this dip...
Imagine options on options... fd on fd
Cohen
what should i swing today
Because it’s dying and easy to manipulate
Nobody ever lost money by securing gains
BABA continuing its run down as it kills itself. Thinking now would be a great entry point to get in on this ride back up.
I’m going to average down lol
They are. Expect them in Q1 2021 tho, not now
If TSLA shoots up it will be a Festivus miracle.
XL was promoted by Shitron... can anyone explain why people are shilling it?
i said that last time BABA crashed about a month ago, and look where i'm at now. You'd think i'd learn a lesson, but that wouldn't be retarded. instead, think i'm gonna have to yolo a few more contracts at a discount. BUY THE DIP
Stonks close at 1 pm today
I’m at 265 avg, the issue is it could be a year before this revounds
$30 and I’ll chug Leroy’s Coconuts
Calls on your number of chromosomes.
Green Morning Everyday.
This green pm gonna give me blue balls...
is your pp smol? or is it XL
Real party is three kings day. Everyone walk in the ocean backwards and naked. Let’s just say shit gets weird.
[removed]
I don’t think it reaches $20 but a retest of $25 would be nice before breaking convincingly over $30+
Weren’t they previously PIC?
Should I sell my BABA 300c 3/21 today??
FCEL 200 Shares @ $12.00
Imagine selling today
Im thinking BABA after this huge drop
Thanks random WSB guy, it’s not like there are a hundred tickers getting spammed everyday.
And Hanukkah 🕎
Exactly. The hard part is what to think about the GA runoff senate elections. If dems win it will probably jump to 50 lol
Stimulus talks going well...
Cathie wood loves it
watch me turn this half day into a no day while staring at candles all morning
This place is great
that 695 last week was a preview
should i wait for a dip to buy XL or is that boy mooning
Baba money gonna rotate into OZON and JMIA
STIC is way too high to buy, the damn merger isn’t even until q2
the flattest pre market i have ever seen in my life, what the hell?
MGNI and DFS will either get me a lambo for Xmas or ramen.
Lol
Just buy it for tendies
Imagine selling at Christmas, fucking unpatriotic pussies
BABA$ HAS BEEN #EXCOMMNICADO
Ah ok thank you 👍🏻
bought baba calls yesterday  merry christmas
Sold my shares last night, but leaps are dead
Fuck all of you
Papa Elon please let my TSLA 655 12/24 FD’s print... 🙏🙏🙏🙏🥺🥺🥺
PLZ SPY 370
Michael Burry said so
not moonin 😭
Exactly this. I’ve been saying this but people who believe these “probes” are similar to the US and are non-material are fucking delusional.
The only reasonable explanation
Okay TMO please don’t immediately give up gains at open thank you.
It’s not gay if Elon does it to you
Is BTWN still a 50/50 on landing Tokopedia?
Congress adjourned. Neither party got unanimous consent for their agendas. Next session on Monday 2pm lol
Someone give me a good call to spend $100 on pls
Haven't heard that in 12 seconds
Is PLTR really staying below 29 until next year?
they make an electric/hybrid power sources basically. you can just integrate it into established production lines. rather than produce whole vehicles themselves. makes alot of sense seeing as even TSLA has trouble meeting production quotas even thugh they have plenty of money and facilities.
Amen
Now Nio dying because baba fuck China
Averaging down personally
Fuck PLTR, I had to say it
Y
No shit.
4/16 $19 VALE call
This. Plus I get a ton of head. Idk if it’s the culture or what, but I get head almost every morning.
no, it's 3 days old.
i sold some at 1.60
Buying options on riot or mt is like buying options on options if you think about it.
700 eod
What you get?
GME shares right now
650 here. 10 of them
Basically, they have a hybrid solution already in place and on the road. Lots of customers. Growth potential in a few years is solid.   Not sure if $35 solid, but there's definitely nothing wrong with it, especially with the current EV madness.
Prob
BABA$    #FATALITY 🔥🔥🔥🔥🩸🩸🩸🩸
What will the bug men do?  Break Ali baba up?
Bears in shambles
GME TO 10
My stocks always fucking moon right before open. I hate this shit.
If you don’t have already have a plan, then yeah sell while you’re ahead
God the people talking about BABA in here are so fucking retarded. Do you really think our trading day is going to do anything different then HKs, where the fucking company is located? The day is already mapped out, go look at baba.HK, add $5-7, that’s where we close.
Baba leap
A collect call to both your dads
Look at chewy son. It’s early
With BABA getting hit with monopoly anti-trust, those damn Chinese commies really will not let us profit seeking capitalists gain too much control.  Long JD.
That’s because it’s “pleas”
XL is anything but flat.
Wait for the drop of the first 30 minutes and buy 0 date calls
Myself?!😂😂😅😂
Half day... most institutional traders are off today... going to be very low volume... let’s squeeze the crap outta GME and show analysts the true power of WSB. Shares not calls!
Do i sell my baba Jan 2022s ?
Btfd
I’m not sure you quite understand what it is you’re saying.  Even if they “opened up” everything, which for the most part already are save a couple states, unemployment is high right now and some of those jobs just aren’t there anymore.  Congress dragged their feet too long and the effects of it are not proportionate.    So if you think it’s wasteful, when you get your $600 you should probably send yours back.
it dipped this morning but it got gobbled up.
OK Greatest Generation
seems that a lot of people are betting it's a done deal
Baba$. Oh boy all the margin calls and stop losses we about to see
they always pop when a merger is announced and then drop down, just wait a few weeks.
I'm loaded to the tits with February calls
yikes
Yeah but it's up 17% premarket
9:30 dump into 10:30, trade flat all day, EOD dump at 12:50
Watt 05-21 $4c
What do you think about buying $BABA dip at open?
Oh it’s mooning. It’s hitting 60
It's going to baidu
ITS GONNA BE THE SUMMER OF GMEORGE
DONT SELL YOU PUSSIES
🤣
XL Calls?
hoping for more from FEYE today :pray:
Yeah... Could use that money elsewhere for sure. Just hate selling this at a loss
Not for sq$ it’s gonna sky rocket bruh
literally woke up and bought the XL dip. merry xmas to me.
tell me more about this FLIR you speak of
u sir are a raging psychopath
Baba gonna rape me in 15 minutes. Anyone think market is overreacting? Should I average down at open?
Looks like this fucking retard u/Durado made another account
All I know is that it's 100% tendies.
i believe it may hit 42-44 today, just don’t know if i should expect a dip for short sellers
Ford started making cars 100+ years before Tesla. guess that headstart didn't matter much.
So no 2k ?
Baba calls at open for a quick in and out
Imagine how scared those “professional” shorters must be right now.
Doesn’t seem like it’s going to happen but it’s a great management so next target might be even better
Real shit is there gonna be a GME dip I can wait for or do I need to get in ASAP
Everyone's got fomo, if you're lucky, there might be a dip, btfd
Darn shimmy till Monday
Pltr gonna get manipulated as fuk today.
What 🐝 gonna do
Thankfully, a lot of people here were saying that- it helped reinforce that point. As great a company is Baba, they can’t beat the govt
[removed]
Yeah for sure. Maybe even a few months. There’s bound to be some deep lows imo
All I see is more stimi news pumping next week lmao 🤡🤡 market only goes up
My entire watchlist is green...except for GOEV.  😶
Shares? Sure  Options? Whats the expiration
[removed]
A male escort with a fat bulge   Enjoy your Christmas my friend
One the warrants get called then the gap shrinks to $11.50 or thereabouts
vote on monday now
Whole watchlist is green as fuck. I have a bad feeling this shit is about to dump
BABA ah ah ah  BABA Ooh la la
Do you really want to bet against xi jinping
There's a weird 28.8 resistance on PLTR that's so freaking horizontally straight.
**I BETTER SEE BABA LOSS PORN TODAY**
Apparently the house vote just failed. Market unmoved. Holy shit.
no, u buy more
the fact it jumped after a post from a respectable WSB member is so absurd for me to think about lmao, we are the market movers now
More stimi talks again
I'm in the same boat... Rip us
No, retard.
Any call recommendations to buy at market open for this week ?
Wait for a dip, if there is one today
when will i learn that premarket means NOTHING
She's cute I hope she replaces Becky. Im too hungover for that crow so it was a pleasant surprise to see the new Burnette
I’m so fucked
My Amzn put credit spread shows a larger loss than my collateral on Robinhood. Is there some possibility that my max losses could exceed my collateral? I thought losses were capped at the difference in strike minus the credit received.
Do you like losing money?
Baba gonna need the resurrecting stone. Jack ma stand by
Gme
Who knows?
For me game console cycle and Ryan Cohen
👀G anyone?
Np
i'm worrying about the same thing
I hate pltr
STIC on a moon mission with volume lol
I'm serious I need a win what yall got. 45 dte plz
GUH
Hold NIO or fomo into XL?
Should I wait for a dip to buy the McRib or should I go all in when McDonalds open?
I don’t expect it to go below $19
We’re full up here  🇨🇦
i have an AAPL 1/8 132c and i’m ready to start crying
buy the dip fellas
Buy 10 GME shares if you read this
That is the way. The american way
And now they will be free to fall out of relevance without the EU.
Exp August 21
Only baba if u in that u were already a traitor
Fellow retards, what do we think of Social Capital?
Macy’s stock
Everything I own is fuk today
See what happens first , I bet people will sell the stock because of the FUD for the first 5 mins and you can buy it at the bottom unless it's not the bottom and it will go down more next week. Then you should wait and after new years.
No stimulus was priced in
What are we predicting GME to hit?
Gonna rip at open I can feel it. They’re gonna try to shake us out in the first 10 minutes
Hoping for a nice little CRM gain today
Also CRWD is poised to explode
Cathie buy GME when
This is why Elon is smart by ass kiss China every time
Palantir – "I love it when you talk dirty to me."
Yes, but you're here, right? I'd say wait for a dip if you're gonna hold long term. But there will probably be a rush to buy this morning (I assume you also saw the SIR_JACK_A_LOT DD).
Unemployment is high because of government restrictions preventing people from working, shopping, etc. The government needs to spend less, not more.
DON'T FOMO INTO XL BUY NGA
Stimulus talks going well
Since Congress is adjourned until Monday, what would get us to 370? Brexit deal?

Imagine when Apple first launched, and went up 18% so someone said fuck it.
I also need to know the answer to this.
With this volume, its shooting sideways again
It's not really hard. You find the right SPACs and you go all in on calls if possible. Easiest money I've ever made.
Hold or sell SQ calls at open (235c 12/31)

Almost like someone’s selling
Jumped in XL yesterday at 25. Got stopped out at 24. An hour later the Citron tweet oof

Fuck I guess I should as well. Own some in an IRA.
I think by the time we see a dip it’ll hit 38-40
BTWN up 17% premarket
Imagine if nio went down too. Need me some popcorn
XL is making me rich but I might roll some into Pershing in case there’s a Christmas miracle?
Who was the original vale dd guy. Thank you sir
XL? Omg these Blank check companies need to fucking stop already.
The day I get aggressive on my covered calls and sell a $30 weekly is the day it will take off.

Do I sell my april 2021 300c ?
It’s only up 134% this week.
great GME dd this morning from a guy who noticed that BABA is the 2nd largest long holding of Melvin Capital, the single biggest GME short.  BABA tanking could put a lot of margin pressure on them, depending on their financing setup.  Thought this was a pretty interesting/compelling point.
F to my baba call holders

Why ? Cause it’s Christmas  lol ?
no and ur still early if you get in now. 80% of traders took the entire week off.
I know what you’re thinking.  That in Dave Thomas, founder of Wendy’s but nope. I’m just a retard buying PLTR and GME
Next week. If you sell shares today or bail on the down slow, the shorts win.

Just bit me in the Christmas tookus :(
Dude those socialist bastards the fucking over half the sub who own baba. Maybe this is too soon
no more $2000?
GME likely to dump, or just enter at the opening and dont mind?
Bought 75 shares of $STIC (because that dude with the big account said to) during pre-market. Looking good so far.
baba why?
We don’t know your brother?
RIP to my BABA calls  Very un-merry Christmas
I mean WSB is basically more expensive than heroine
xi is already a trillionaire.
This is a great opportunity to buy BABA, great company, loyal customers. Just don’t expect this to be done anytime soon. Jack Ma is known to work with the government and alibaba is the same.

This is a weird feeling that im not worried about SPCE today.
I had thought he was more of a hype-follower, since he was previously jumping onto the flavour of the moment (PTON, CRSR, GME, etc.). Seems like his first major foray into DD.

Can we just not open today? Its a waste of time unless puts are bought.

I’m not sure how it is where you are but most businesses have been impacted by the COVID spreading.  And even with some of the changes there are still 326k deaths.  Now imagine the toll without the precautions they took and the bigger impact it would have had.

I find it very frustrating when someone puts a ten bagger in here and I look up the symbol and uhhhh I can't even trade options on it??? Are we gambling or not whats going on here
Wow my account is about to blow up today on PLTR calls unless there is a miracle
Please go uppies SPY, I need to get out of my FDs for not 80% loss :'(
Trump completely fucked it over.  The spending bill + stimulus bill was passed by both Houses.
Bought at open, prolly fucked myself
Not ICLN
Its up premarket tho, you got puts?
All in BABA
I’m fucking excited for it to drop tn

You forget the market makes no sense my friend. Just watch it dump
It was always going to happen, seriously you thought it had a shot? Lol
BABA$ investors   “ you got to know when to hold em , know when to fold em “   “Know when to suck cock and learn how to cry “
Well the call it now $10, so it didn’t seem like I burned money.
I mean it’s going to be .01 so you might as hold
Twitter is balls deep in it. There are calendars with what phase each one is in and when the merger vote is.
PLTR and a morning dump name a better duo
I was promised a short squeeze today
They know you were going to YOLO and lose it anyway so they just skipped a step for you
Baba puts at open orrrr????
Congress should give a specific stimulus to us BABA share holders
If you do spreads, you need margin.
Amen
Missed out huh?
This is possibly a dumb question, but how the fuck do y’all know what companies these blank check spacs are trying to merge with? Like XL was previously PIC, did y’all know PIC was turning into XL beforehand?

1. Anyone who actually thought 2k would be approved is a fucking tard and clueless about the legislative process  2. Baba is being investigated by the CCP not the SEC. get your head out of your ass and realize this is only the beginning
government shutdown. SPY 320 here we come!
XL sell off at open
I assume none. Because doing anything more than basic buying options has the risk of losing more money than you have
Genuinely curious about this too.
I was so close to going big on BABA leaps about a month ago. So glad I can lose that money in an otherwise heartbreaking fashion.
by the time it's done drilling...it'll be in the courthouse

Calm down $BABA holders, now not the time for fear   That comes later

PLTR fade at open is as predictable as my wife cooking a shitty dinner

Right we’re it ended yesterday so prepare for the epic sell off
OPEN THE MARKET LET ME AT EM LET ME AT EM!
why do i always believe these posts for a second even though i know they’re based on nothing
Read the company news
Chicoms cannot be fucked with, rip BABA
The focus of the BABA investigation is actual monopolistic behavior (requiring merchants not to seek through other platforms). If China just imposes a measured punishment of a large fine, like the West would impose, I think this would recover pretty quickly and signals that capital investment is safe in China.
Shitron put a PT of $60 on XL, thoughts?
What kind of company are they?
You comparing share price?
They never email me back anyways
I win if you win, brother
How can I reduce the loss of my shitty baba calls? Is there any possibility? (I am extremely retarted pls be sorry)
Yes.  SPACs sign a nonbinding LOI, then a confirmed DA.
I’ll buy it. We can meet at police station at noon. I have cash.
Thank you for your service
Anyone see the wmt owners and directors dumped a fuck ton of there shares? Or is that too much dd for this sub? Puts?
😭🥲
No, but will certainly keep climbing
So I should put an order in for 205?
So what? Business can be hard, sometimes hurricanes happen, earthquakes, etc. The government getting involved doesn’t help it hurts, they print money, it causes inflation on assets, which pushes poor people further away from things like home ownership in the future. The government doesn’t need to step in and rescue anyone, especially not a business. I run a business, if for some reason what I did stopped being profitable, I would do something else, almost immediately. People are supposed to adapt, not wait for the big government to come fix their problems.
I love getting together with all my bros and getting a massage train going. I love my homies.

To the 0.3 people in this subreddit smart enough to understand this, here's my outlook 5 minutes before the market opens for today:  The heat map of the global power struggle between authoritarians and libertarians is acting a lot like the heat map of climatic temperature offsets. Hot and cool zones moving around the earth sporadically and unpredictably. Right now the west is relatively cool but the east is fluctuating wildly around varying but all above-normal levels of heat like it has been for over a year now and a lot of things that have been bending the whole time are at their breaking point. Since they're on the faux-communism control scheme in most of that hemisphere, the power struggle being in a heat wave in that hemisphere overall means faux-communism is lashing out at capitalism globally right now while the faux-capitalists in the west can afford to take the hit without too much liberty bubbling up in their spheres. Putin will continue ordering Xi to attack capitalists and consolidate the CCCP's power as long as he's dealing with Navalny, and as long as the US is paralyzed by this game of chicken we keep playing with our impending civil war, he doesn't really need to give our injuries much focus. The UK with their border/supply chain crisis is honestly worth more of Putin's attention than the US right now. So the USD is going to keep sliding to make the market look good relative to it, our market will basically keep looking like a circus with random shit happening and news going haywire all the time to keep the cycle of chaos in a stable balanced back-and-forth loop between the bulls and the bears, and most of the interesting action where real shit is happening based on real factors is going to be from the east. So if you like doing actual analysis-based trading for big gains and you're not just here for the casino of gambling on random ups and downs of the circus, pay attention to what's happening with BABA and try playing your money in a country with anything going on other than America's chaos-on-autopilot situation. Trust me, there are enough foreign companies on Robinhood these days, you don't have to sled downhill with USD all winter or hope to get lucky with something like GME by pure random chance.  *In the meeting of mined; down in the streets of shame; in the betting of Names on gold to rust; in the land of the blind, be King*
Your XPEV 4/21 50c will be ok
Why Jan?
Stop asking if Baba call or puts you retards, it's a power struggle and Ma pissed off the current emperor of China. This won't be ending any time soon until China gains full control of BAT.

BABA is a fucking steal. I’ll buy 10x Made in China stonks please.
ARKG
You’re fine dude
Down at open, slow climb through the day, drop 10 minutes before close... as tradition dictates.
I’m not gunna tell you to go long on Ark, just put them on your watch list. They’ll do the rest of the talking from there.
Who else buying STIC? At open lol
I thought it was 255 so I bought a ton yesterday. Hasn’t closed below 255 since July. Then this shit happens. What can I say I’m retarded
Feeling good. Bought 100 shares yesterday at 3pm, after reading that post. If PM holds up then I'm up 20%+ since then.
When people say baba leaps they mean off a tall building right?
I have been watching Big Mouth on Netflix. Maury fucking kills me. "So uh, what are we talkin' about, tits?" "My proctologist won't believe I didn't do this to myself."
Wait for XL dip

Not sure. It's a falling knife but that could go both ways in uncertainty. All most people know is there is an investigation. Whether or not it has teeth will show what happens. If it's a breakup then it's an elevator down to hell but just them showboating their power and a rebound
Baba at June levels....yikes
Got blocked you mean
So who is dumping their BABA calls right at the bottom? I’m going to hold 😤😤😤😤
GOP blocked house dems in passing $2000 stimmy.  GME 30 01/15
why did i not follow the stock market when i was 18. as a 23 year old i feel as if ive missed out on so much (which I have). i could have finessed so much money from my parents and just bought stocks during college fuck
didnt get vetoed.  house is drafting a new bill that will include the $2k checks, and it will die in the senate.
Wow holy fuck RIP BABA  This time it's really fucking dead
yes
5 minutes to Valhalla retards!
Lol u/sir_jack_alot only picks winners
Gonna need a tldr on this one
With BABA tanking, what comparable company should moon?
Highkey needed this stimulus check so that’s really great they teased us for 9 months :/
Why are they so mad at alien head all of the sudden
Gereat buying op
MARA,RIOT AND EBON 🚀
I will not buy at open.  I will not buy at open.  I will not buy at open.
How is aapl looking today?
They have been for years.  People blowing their accounts up trying to short it since the beginning.
They're called "insurance tech" companies. Basically make homebuying and everything involved with it way easier. Check out their website Porch.com
Nah. It’s based on MSFT news about how, they too (like Apple), will design their own chips rather than using Intel or AMD’s
Sssssh Everyone Clam up.
Bulls will be getting a big red dildo as a Christmas present today
The big squeeze that sqouze
A limit down day on Christmas would be a fitting end to this fucking wild-ass year...
Over shorted, beginning of new console cycle, low debt, hostile takeover, E-commerce growth, and share value +375% across the last three months.
Too late indeed
GOODNIGHT MOON!
All these baba cucks haven’t got the memeo? Gme is about to enter fkn orbit 🚀🚀🚀 get with it or enjoy watching everyone get rich while you get screwed.
Yo! Sir Jack A lot got banned!
Well, this is going to be my biggest loss ever on a green day GUH
gay
I dream of a bright and clean planet - ICLN 💚
IF U INVEST IN ANYTHING GYNA U ASKING TO GET YOUR ASSHOLE STRETCHED!!!!   Dude rich people keep  the money in USA for a FOOKIN reason !!!   Learn to play the game
buy and hold for some quick change. You won't regret it.
Everything will selloff once it becomes certain our do-nothing gov't shuts down with no stimulus in sight and the whole package goes back to the drawing board. IWM 1/15 162p for premium flip. Bought a bunch yesterday for 30c.
Huge buy order on NIO.  40,000 shares
Yeah I don't care if they do, just want my $
No miracle happening I’m afraid brother
Haha okay Timone
I never let options expire worthless. Just me
[removed]
Ban
Holy shit BABA
Thinking 4/16 $25c for GME
What’s the deal with FCEL?
PLEASE GME BABY GIVE ME ONE MORE 30 MINUTES SQUEEZE TO FUCKING 24 PLEASE
Btw it's unanimous consent that failed iirc. Thats to be expected because R will want a floor vote
Sitting on the sidelines today. Should be entertaining
Never too late
Doesn’t really exist....the competitors are down too. WMT i guess? Lol
I’m 28 bruh, I’ve been broke most my life, don’t feel so bad
[removed]
What does this mean? Green today and Monday?
Bet yall don't know this but Alex Karp is secretly a fat man named Kris Kringle.
MMs seriously manipulating WMT
Wayyyy too much text, bud.
or just never give our money to israel.
Yeah, just saw it on Twitter.   BUT I BLAME YOU FOR THIS.
Q1 2021 is bright
Too late to hop into cheap gme spreads?
Worst thing to do
[removed]
&gt;ETSY  id like to get out before the dip then buy back
There is not going to be any 2k stimmy. It was a stunt.
Butt wipes have been sold out on amazon for ages now  Puts on my dirty butt crack
can we get other stocks too at june levels..would love to load up again lol
It's a really weak stimulus. $600 and $300/week UI is too little, too late. He has leverage now to force McConnell to pass a bill with bigger direct payments, and I agree with him for once.
OPEN THE GATES!
https://twitter.com/RocketManGuyMan/status/1340741894184161280?s=09
$600 $1200 $2000 Idfc  At this point just pass something and let’s move on
you crazy if you sell NIO now. Major catalysts upcoming.
Very exciting times
Baba calls anyone?
Thanks retard
Bears in shambOs  Bulls picking out lambOs
If you’re not buying NIO and Xpeng you honestly don’t love free money
Yes I picked up 20k worth at 143.70  Give it a month to near earnings it will rocket
Pleas drive again NIO
Least it’ll be more than a weeks worth of groceries beer and weed
tHiS iS oNlY tHe BeGiNnInG
Name a stock you would have missed out on without wsb
I am thinking it will fall little more from here before the end of the year. But it will roar back by early Feb when earnings are due.  Also, China isn’t gonna tank one of their biggest and best companies. It will be a slap on the wrist like the Luckin Coffee fine
nope
GME eod predictions?
Can you guys stop pumping STIC for a minute so I can buy in, thanks
FIST ON CHEST, NO FEAR!   Also, Merry Christmas you filthy animals.
Hold or sell SQ calls at open (235c 12/31)? Looks like its about to drop quick
Funny that the year ends how it began
$2k stimmy failed, shit is going to drill.
can someone explain this GME obsession to me, a dumbass
Tl;dr - nothing to see here.
I TAKE BACKWHATI. SAID NIO IM YOUR BIGGEST FAN ILL FOLLOW YOU UNTIL YOU SHORT SQUEEZE
I took profit for thicc B at 18 cos I predicted a dump after that mad rally due to the lack of a DA catalyst, but it's still going up lmao wth
I know. Gives me false hope as my FD’s drop to zero.
Shit looks like the next XL
What
SSPK because weedmaps
Shieeet
Long, this has a lot of potential in the coming years. Just let it chill
It’s gonna pump like nobody’s FUCKIN BUSINESS
Event coming up or what?
Jeezzz
Ready your pencils.
I eat ass but would never try the Christmas Egg Nog 😬
Nio looks very topped out I think the hype is over.
Sad Christmas
My 34 strike PLTR calls expiry 12/31 WILL PRINT!
Yall think baba is still a good long term and will recover?
Real degenerates buying way otm BABA puts at open and holding for 10 seconds
Feeling better now?
Dream on dreamer
I wouldn’t touch baba bc have you see that fucking website it’s atrocious
how's that huge? NIO has like 170m avg volume retard
Only like a billion dollars worth...
And $SNOW
Found this. Free money.  https://twitter.com/RocketManGuyMan/status/1340741894184161280?s=09
BABA just filling the gap on the daily chart from late June guys. Nothing wrong going on here. Just normal price action. XD
Wow I didn't realize NKLA was already in the 15s, lower than GME lol.
All of them?
Just get a tushy. They are a dream.
Don’t think anyone expected it to pass tho
GME king swapped to STIC yesterday. Don't miss it.
👍🏼😘
Dicked by the pooh
Already did I'm afraid
Trading Places told me this would be a green day
PEOPLE WHO BUY GME CALLS NOW ARE LITERALLY BUYING THE TOP  IF YOU ARE ALREADY IN, GG NICE JOB  IF YOU AREN’T, STAY AWAY LOL
So we’re not getting that $600 check next week huh
Lobbyists
🍆🍻
Buy pltr
Any dip buys except baba ? I think Baba has to go below 200 to be a a good buy
Why
BABA 🤤👅🌈🐻
It takes like a week to show up on RH, even it shows like it shows up as complete on your banks end; bank transfers are just slow
GME TO A VERY LOW NUMBER :)
🥭 is going to absolutely destroy the GOP now. Probably priced in though.
Follor r/SPAC, theres a lot of good discussion there
😢
Any 5x today? Any trade ideas
Are you surprised?
Seriously, dont
TLDR - Putin has America running on autopilot right now so nothing but random market swings will happen here just to fuck over traders. Play foreign shit for a little while unless you just love gambling in a gay market
[removed]
I'm in on GME but all the bullshit you assholes are spewing has me worried.  Its starting to sound like PLTR.
Selling BABA right now would be stupidity call holders. You would be selling right at the bottom. 😒😒😒
thicc b or GOEV? or too late on both?
2 minutes to find out how stupid am I really
CNRG better
about to take off in a few minutes, should I sell my calls at open? going to be in the air for about an hour
Mane shares, but those 50c expiring today not looking so hot
PLTR miracle please
It’ll go back to normal pending what the results of this are. Look at the 1 month chart
big fax
Waiting for market open...  Is account going to 🚀 or ☠️
Thank God JD is coming back.
FCEL or bust
lol that news doesn't matter
sooo is market dumping today due to no stimmy
I agree but like no need to rub salt in the wounds of so many fellow autists
Baba drama going to drill us today
shop
AAPL,PLTR,NET,ATVI,SRNE
Hydrogen is gonna be pushed since its a green energy. I like FCEL better than plug because they do big generators.   Pfizers main campus uses a FCEL fuel cell to power it, not the grid. More things will move this way.
Damn!
And Sudan and all the other countries that have zero fucking buisness being in that bill, ie all of them.
Marry Christmas to everyone but the mods See yall monday

my 132c never gonna print
The GME king left it yesterday for STIC
GME 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
no checks for you
Don't know if I can handle it honestly...
You don't know bottom and you don't understand Asians
Pleas don’t fly again GME ✈️🔥 fly like the Boeing 787max
fucking F.N.K.O going vertical.
I’m laughing. Of course she’s Cuban we love sucking dick haha. I bet shes a smart woman too. My family fled to FL when Castro took over too. All the ones that stayed are communist
GOEV is still good to go!
GME 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀. Buy and hold for easy tendies.
I cashed my baba longs out for $276 a share back in Nov.   Holy shit that worked out
This dudes truly are the grinch
SPY moon or tank today? Someone give me a play for today for SPY
Yes
I think it's pretty noteworthy. I've been to my local mall many times and never saw any CNBC employees there in or out of a reporter's capacity
So many BABA autists don’t even realize Jack MA abandoned ship.   Papa MA will not save you.
FEYE what the shit
his stic post is deleted looks like
Where can i view shares being purchased?
Last one before we have to switch to our gambling apps for the weekend. Make it count.
#HOLD ONTO YOUR BUTTS
U need to chill for a second
Any Chinese company
But I want more 0dte fd’s
Also maybe you’re right and it’s not cultural. Maybe it’s the massive bank account and lawyer status thing. Who knows.
IM SCARED
I hope you all make money today. 🙏💰
Strap in

**ALLAHU AKBAR BOISSSS 🚀 **
If it was SEC Baba would have thrown some money to shut the fuck up but these CCP retards are not going to budge even with money. They want Jackma as CCP's puppet.
Lmao nice troll
Hope none of my fellow Chads are holding BABA today
Buy the fucking $BABA dip at open!!  As if China would harm one of their most important companies
[removed]
The people that are calling GME the new Blockbuster were the same ones calling BBY Circuit City.
BABA literally gonna take all my 2020 gains away from me

Actually?
So you really think baba will lose 20 percent value on an investigation.......
Oh yeah I know - it was supposed to be completed today and RH sent me a notification saying it was done. Just not seeing the money actually in my account. Frustrating.
Xl got me so hard
On your marks
Good. The dems and the gop need to be flushed. They don’t care about the American people... they only care about special interest.

Good luck guys.
House republicans block $2000 checks soooo now what
Loading Mara.
Rmg is at 30.......thic b is on its way
Okay having thought about this BABA situation a bit more here is where I’ve landed:  I think it’s gonna be a slap on the wrist.  BABA is such a poster child for Chinese tech.   The reason I don’t think they will fuck over BABA  too badly is that it’s going to have very negative consequences for other chineese companies to be able to raise funding from abroad.  If investors are going to always be worried that the Chineese government can fuck over a tech company they are going to be much less willing to buy shares in chineese companies. It will negatively impact valuations.   So think XI will use this more as a warning shot and not full on fuck them over.  However there is still a small chance obviously that Xi doesn’t care about any of that and he just has a personal vendetta.  I’m gonna buy some shares at open and then monitor next few weeks and see which way this is going then buy more if looking like a slap on wrist.   I think there’s a 30-40 percent upside here if it’s just a slap on the wrist and I’m not investing any money I can’t afford to lose.   I definitely would not YOLO and go all in!
Here we go!!
Why?
same lol
retards... I sold some of my shit and got around $2,000. Gimme a SPAC to throw into.
BABA to $0
For real. And they sell the shittiest shit ever you have to wait three months to get. Knock offs and lies. Would never invest in that garbage.
No clue why.  That’s some gay ass shit.. mods!
I get some stocks are meant to be held but I can’t stand watching AMD hemorrhage 1% every day until it has a 5% day to reset to 95 every week
TSLA TO THE MOON
Really dont know when to take profits on it
someone hit the crazy button
fuck YES TSLA!!!!
Not Trump apparently; he just ignored the bill, didn't veto it, just ignored it and went to play golf. A big F U to the Americans that need the stimulus money ASAP.
How so?
Lol STIC no fucking way
Ahh 2k stimmy lol, no one expected that
Stfu bitch   I warned people not to invest in GYNA shit   Now u suck it up ok   U wanna play smart u get ass fucked
GOD SPEED BABA CALL HOLDERS. LETS SEE HOW BADLY OUR ASSES LOOK AFTER TODAY.
good luck everyone and merry christmas eve 🎄🎅

Normally I like spreads, but its a $20 stock.  If you stay cautious there's no harm in going naked on this one.
Once it’s down $8. That’s 1st year stuff man
Tidal was great for high def music. But then Amazon Music came in with ultra HD music and a larger catalog.   I cancelled my Tidal account.

ok folks, bought my GME FDs.  DO YOUR PART
These FCEL dips 🥵
PLTR share price is too low imo
Mods, unban u/SIR_JACK_A_LOT ! We all need to hear about his Christmas miracle gain porn
Hi dumbass, I'm retarded. Huge short interest that has to cover, so the price will rise and eventually everyone in this sub with diamond hands will hold the bag.   If you get out early you have fomo. If you get out on time you're rich. If you get out late your calls expire worthless and your shares can be turned in like a used xbox game for 1/20th of their actual value.
You’re not using a gambling app to trade options?
BABA call holders right now # 𓀐𓂸
PLTR TO 30
Jeeze nio

Better hop into $XL now before it’s too late! 🚀🚀🚀🚀
Man I just wanted to lock in profit but that was retarded of me
Lol oh boy, there it goes....haha
I hope Jack MA doesn't get cucked by Winnie the pooh
can you elaborate on this? Didn’t find anything online. With bitttcoiin at ath and mining becoming more lucrative, this should have further growth potential
It’s drilling all the way to China
rip BABA
God I hate shortened trading days. Either go full day or take the day off.
V-shaped recovery...COME ON V-SHAPED RECOVERY.
PLTR gang is the most annoying, but GME gang the most sensitive gang

STIC to the moon
BABA 😰  The crazy part is I'm still tempered to buy more shares.

Apple calls let’s go
Kind of catching a lifetime holiday movie vibe from it all.  It’s 🎄 and you have sworn enemies that have a little bit of sexual tension and edging the hell out of everyone. Add in a little social media drama and wild improbable to impossible events and the holidays are saved.  Everyone getting tendies on Xmas is kind of a fitting end to the US culture war
If you guys have the patience, NVTA leaps would be nice
This guy is making so much money off WSB, wtf
XL TAKE ME TO VALHALLA
Spacs have been on a tear this week
Why’s the hype
WRONG WAY GME, ATTENTION WRONG WAY!!!
Pls bring baba down to covid prices.

Ridiculous what’s going on with BABA rn. Seems like a China is shooting themselves in the foot with this one. This is not beneficial for any party
HOLy SHit BFT finally waking up
Hope you all bought the NET dip
I got into STIC at $19 🙃
Very cool Tesla very legal

BABA shares, FCEL calls (bought EOD of course), VXX calls.  I am getting roasted today, then again I look at those 3 positions to begin with and question my entire being
I like AMD but I’m done doing options with it. Why the fuck does it just keep falling?

I bought the BABA dip.
Finally! I was starting to loose faith
Can’t believe I was scared away by a 10% spike yesterday, damn!
Nooooooo!   *pukes*
Why?+ the 28c is  only 1cent extra
BABA "merchants are forced to sell exclusively on Alibaba"  Sounds bullish to me.
Alot of dump at open but SPXS and VIX are also down. Interesting
HxH ED 1 is so fire but idk why, never thought i would like screaming vocals over a weird techno beat but fuck it

“Was his last words “
bro FUCK the pdt rule
It’s aids
Santa will bring you coal
Buying the dip on MARA after they issued shares to raise capital is the easiest play to date.
Not being able to trade STIC on any of my platforms is killing me
F
Bold of you go assume we’ve seen the bottom.
I feel like ark funds always nose dive at open then recover. Let's just hope for a 2-4% recovery
as soon as aapl hits 132 everyone just sells. WEAK
Should sold ICLN at open 🤡
Is GME squeezing today, Monday, or never?
just sell so that it can rocket soon
Imagine panic selling ICLN 😂
AAPL - SQ - TSLA - PLTR - RIOT  GANG GANG SQUAD SAY WASSUP TO YA BOi
10% of my portfolio is in dog food why am I like this
Samesies, but the day off reckoning is nearing.
F
Shouldn’t they freeze BABA for 10 minutes? These guys are just panicking that Winnie the Pooh will rein fiery terror.
Is ICLN kill?
No shit,  i hope that bitch goes up
GME is dead fuck
Everyone is making their own processors now and their GPUs aren't the best. If you wanted in AMD you should've bought stocks.
Cringe
Anyone grabbing more 🐝 at this level?
TSLA pleas fly again today. 😢
Plug taking a massive dump doesn’t help 😔
Jack Ma is probably colluding with Navalny to try to overthrow faux-communism in the whole East so no I don't expect any authority over there to go easy on him tbh
Explain

Next week 50 strike had huge volume yesterday so I bought. Regretting it now.

xpeng keeps fucking me everyday and I'm sick of it
Buy any Chinese stock that's not related to BABA and doesn't have Monopolistic or regulatory problems with the gov't. These are down because of ETF groupings.

Sometimes you have to go down first so you can go up later
Gang 👊🏻
I fucking hate opens lately
LETS GOOOO TSLA
GME pleas fly again
VIX is a ETF dedicated to market volatility, when it goes up, generally means theres a lot going on with the market, generally sell offs. SPXS is where bears go to buy calls if overall amount of puts are on the rise. If there is a sell off, generally VIX should go up. SPXS is generally a good indicator for bulls to watch if the market is about to fall on its face. Keep these two plus spy on a watch list and it can be a early indicator if shit is going to hit the fan. Dont know what to make of it with alot of sell off buy these 2 being down
Picked up some baba leaps on the downlow 🤒
PLTR doing the thing again
Fuck you, I’m buying more CRSR. Shit is gonna be wild in a year
SPCE don't let them bring you down! Fly!
FEYE reminding why I shouldn't FOMO

Well how ya doing rn
Bullish on iCar because we know where they stand wrt data privacy. Does Tesla sell their customers data/telemetry?
It was a time when everyone wondered if tesla would break $700.
Today will probs be low volume as market closes at 1pm and the fact that many of the big boys are off today, so vix should be predictably low
I'm also a space vurgin
If u don’t have XL you’re just some retard on wsb

Conservative estimate

Look at mister money bags over here with a position that costs 100% more.   In all honesty I wasn’t thinking about it and I just chose the highest available strike, it’s too early for me to be thinking critically apparently.
Square headed fuck jack ma blowing up my account

All indices are green but you sure as hell wouldn’t know it looking at my portfolio 😂
AMD bounce
Heart pulsing. Accidentally shorted 100 shares of AI. +$650 in the 13 seconds between open and close of the position. Fuck, that could have ended fucking terrible.
Cya Monday

At the end of the tunnel. See you there
Buy the renewables dip, it’s much steeper than usual open CHOO CHOO
Lol NIO and Xpeng just keep giving people opportunities only for most people to FOMO in on the top after the next big run
FUBO
Oh GME? Are you ab to do something?
Back from yesterday with black eyes ready for round two. Let’s goooo
They also own GME and BB...
If it happens it won't be until a few hours before close. On a normal day that would be maybe 1 or 2pm, today it could be 10 or 11am.
Bullish.
Go AMD you can do this!
AMD let’s fucking go!!! Su bae
BABA only made my portfolio -15%. I'm still alive. Bought a BABA leap and a Jun cause what else can I do
Come on apple I gotta buy some groceries today.
You'll be fine
Invested in BABA when the first IPO back in 2016. It's an awesome company, but it's tough to invest in companies that are run by a communist government. Sure you have the assurance of the Chinese government in some cases, but that's also the thing that makes investing in these companies scary at times. Luckin Coffee is a very recent example, and now Baba. This is a ploy by Xi to get even with Jack Ma for him trying to have ANT go public without his Ma's consent.
This
While we all want Pltr to take the fuck off already. People in here crying bc it has traded sideways is just dumb. We all knew it was a long play. We got a gift when it went from 15-30 in a week. This support is actually bullish af just chill, it will happen.
Volume is abysmally low. Pretty obvious that it's being pushed down by bigger players
Where the fuck is Santa
Dumping at open how original, mm are not fooling me I got 💎👏
Petition to UNBAN u/SIR_JACK_A_LOT !
Same shit happened to me, F fidelity
BABA holy shit
lmfao garbage fucking meme stocks dying today
Honestly I can't decide if this is sarcasm anymore
Can FUBO please recover

AAPL KEEP GOING YOU FUCKS. MY ROPE IS HERE
When Xi is gone 😬
Santa baby
I pity those who sell gme
Don't forget about the half day today everyone! Market closes at 1pm EST/10am PST! EOD dump is typical for half days
The fuck is the 3 day rule?
Early Christmas present from the IRS!  \#alwayspositive
Who just sells 5k shares of PLTR 25 cents below the market price?  It can’t be... market makers trying to keep it below 28 can it?
FUBO CRASH AND BURN
Boung is exploding in a few day
GIVE ENERGY !!  HELP IS ON THE WAY!!
Went balls deep in STIC yesterday and I think I sold the top for the first time in my life.  That’s a wrap for this week boys. Happy holiday!!
The ark hype got me but I’m out now, everything in those etfs are at crazy all time highs, I was too late and missed the boat, if it has a dip eventually I may get back in.
They have the cheapest price per month in regards to a full sports package versus the competition.
Canoo dipped why though?
This market is going to tank in January. Market is already flat the last 20 days.
i don’t think ittl go past 132.50 although i hope i’m wrong
Tim 🍏
Pltr - kindly fuck off you piece of shit
Ccp is doing it not Jack ma
I’m gonna need PLTR to hit 30 before I see my FIL tonight

Why is it going down?
To just under $30 and back down to 27-28 again.
Intentional or not his post legit turned into a pump n dump lol
\+2% -&gt; -4% my paperhands are shaking!
Hope you bought the XL dip
I hate when stocks go up close to 1% at open and then play with my emotions and bleed the rest of the day.... nothing is more homo
Wait for the pull back
Sir jacka lot got banned for promoting PUMP n DUMPS (STIC)
Here we go FCEL 🚀

ICLN recovering
FUBO dip for anyone wanting on the ride
Yes
Volume spiked due to jack alot
You seem wise. Should I dump my baba or buy more?
Xl gonna recover?
CLDR already burning me
This must be what the Great Depression felt like
I'm starting to think you fellas are just yelling at stocks like the people who bet on horses and yell their number out but don't really know what you're doing.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  same here.
PLTR dump over? ALL IN BOYS
#Babadook 👺
Bought some 0dte GME 22c at 20.50. Let’s see how this plays out.
Ban.  Oh.. wait

Amazon doesn’t move anymore. Play another stock’s earnings run up.  Counterpoint: iv is low because it doesn’t move anymore.
Cathie bae know's her shit and did small DD and checked in what these guys are up to, I might average down but I don't like to buy at the top
STIC pump and dump. Classic.
Falling back to Arda.
Nah, be one last FOMO to get juniors xmas card money from grandma...
Sensible.  Thank you
Ok idiots AMD is going up you can fomo now i know you dont like buying red stonks
You jinxed it my dude
Tesla done
GME! GME! GME!
I would like to imagine that new shorters entering GME pushed the price down and old shorters exhaled a sigh of relief, only to continue living the nightmare of being insanely underwater because they tried to short GME during a new console cycle
Uep
Tim 🍏? More like Tim 💚
Or divorce your wife and her boyfriend
Come on playas, got room on this QS rocket!
Same tree. Different branch.
Hey VALE, would it help if I got out and pushed???
Probably but I think it's the $65 as a whole that could be concerning. For example alot of people have cut pay tv out and stream sports through other platforms- legal or illegal. I think part of the concern could be that a consumer recession continuing forces people to cancel. Of course this is my guess as to why the PT is at $8
Idk why IPOF is moving but I bought 55 shares yesterday so this works out lol
Ill be bagholding this STIC for a while
Got out of my 50 369 SPY calls for 600$ loss. Lesson learned. Always check the time when you buy for a scalp. (Bought right when market closed) and didn't want to ride them out so I sold at open.
What does that mean?
See ya next week
That was a gift for everyone that missed the last few days. Hope everyone got in.
Aapl getting me my Christmas gift money back. God bless America.
C'mon LAZR you were doing so well
Yea I have no chill and shitty Vanguard filled for 19/share. I will probably dump another spac or CRSR for a loss to average down if I have to
Fuck you BABA fuck you PLTR fuck you TSLA. Fuck you Jack Ma and Xi Dada too. Merry christmas everybody.
Hold or sell my VALE $19c 3/19 over weekend? Down 32% and dont want to get theta raped
[https://ibb.co/kxXN7LJ](https://ibb.co/kxXN7LJ)  I've started looking on amazon for rope. Hopefully that bumps your amazon stocks
Baba dead dead
The board at my hedgefund are all boomers   The 'Three Day Rule' tells investors and stock traders to wait a full three days before buying a stock that has been slammed due to negative news.  So they always have a wait and see cash is king approached on a bluechip that gets hammerd
Brave man
[removed]
Learned that the hard way, but thankfully only looking at -$70.  Gl, that sounds reasonable
Even on open selloff my ICLN leaps only lose 2% 😎  every green day gives me 10-20%
People are not going to be happy with SIR\_JACK\_A\_LOT.
semiconDONKters
my baba shares are doing just fine
When will MT volume spike?
Who here had BABA calls
Last chance grab icln under 28 Shit should get more calls? $33
The main thing WSB has taught me is that when people overexaggerate a stock thats mooning, or is a MUST BUY DIP, or anything like that, they are 99% a bagholder who bought at ATH and wants to break even and cash out. The other 1% is someone who has some weekly calls and are worried.
aapl 130 c’s printing
You’re a retard dude January is super bullish
Yep horse race ticker spam guys
Rofl China going after AAPL next
Baba calls
Already down 10% at market open. I just keep getting facefucked by BABA
Wait until it get to 215 and buy
BOINGGG
Dont ppl in China own BABA as well this seems like it hurts there own too
gonna use my ARK gains to genetically delete the autism out of my brain
Same
The moment I sell GOEV...that shit will moon 🤡
GO AMD GO!!!!
I'm buying but I might be retarded
Bought 38 PLTR contracts on that dip
GO APPL GO
It's ok BABA, you go when the CCP lets you.
Way too many open calls on PLTR 30 for it to blow past right now.
Buying dips until I’m broke yes sir!   *coughs*  *pukes*
But let’s be real you could have shorted any stock at open and have a 95% chance of making money
Well it was a SPAC, which debuts around 10.50 due to the amount of cash they are holding. I think it could hit 20 dollars easy if people catch on
BFT ooga booga
TATTOOED CHEF ON A MOON MISSION
God damn the stink market looks retarded today.  Low volume whiplash?
Cheers
God bless America and all the bools
BUY AMD FEB CALLS NOW
You've all done some questionable shit but if you're not buying the ⚡motors dip you might actually be retarded
If there’s a dip, buy!
Thank you Tim apple I am done for today! 💰
Better realize some of those losses before the year ends to lighten your tax bill.
Dumbest thing I've read
TTM SCALPER ALERT!!!!!🚨🚨🚨🚨

Baba gang 😢 😭
Nice for you to join the party AMZN
Buying the FUBO dip
Bought at 15.80 AH last night, sold this morning at 18.90  Was happy with $1500
GL.
So sad to see baba never catch a break. If only they weren’t Chinese would prob have a pt of like 800-1000
idk when to sell this AAPL 132 1/8 c
Little manipulation on a low volume day haha not concerning imo
I lost 20k on BABA, I’m not gonna lie I thought it would be more.
Today half day and tomorrow closed yes?
What’re we buying the dip on?
Probably early-mid jan, hopefully before then
NIO rotation into GOEV.
Max pain is 28? We always go exactly to a point and stay flat on it every end of week.
[removed]
good luck
How can you tell?
I wanna give a shout out to the hard F that is driving down CARR, buying 1 mil shares exactly as markets close, to then sell at the beginning of everyday.   It's not even a meme stock, fuck off.
I need a sant RKT today
Tim Apple let’s hit 135 today
GME CEO IS A NAZI HOW DARE YOU BUY! NAZI NAZI NAZI SELL SELL SELL
Or even PLUG. ICLN owns a big percentage of that

AAPL celebrating Christmas early.
Selling strangles on PLTR free money
btw big fan of tesla too, don’t tar and feather me.
FEYE proving it has staying power and didn't just spike to fall
I hope so - I'm up 400%+ on luckin. Let BABA bottom out, then buy as close to the bottom as you can.
Imma be honest this sounds hella gays
Not very forward looking. Considering the moves they're making to implement sports gambling into the platform. I pay for Fubo/Spectrum and it costs less than  any Comcast or cable package out there with sports, at least to what's available to me.
MMs trying to not let XL exceed $33
No

Took PLTR profits and moved to AAPL. Let’s go Tim Apple 🍏
Only 2 more dollars and I’ll delete loss and post gain porn, Tim. Your move.
Lol I literally shorted FUBO at the top at 61 🤑🤑🤑
I’m still fuckin green on my calls retard. You were saying?
I grabbed some
$CHWY!!! 🚀🚀
Holy shit this sux.
Very good observation!
si si
If you're even thinking about touching Baba, it better be in SHARES only. While I LOVE the company, this antitrust probe has me a little concerned. I'd buy a little on every dip, and then be patient. It could be a little while until this rebounds.
Expiration date
sold ilikf yesterday at 2.22 and its now 3.50. that's soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo cool
Imagine learning anything here
BABA, just killed a retard,  Puts against his life,  Pulled my trigger, now he’s ded,  BABA, margin has just called,  But my portfolio is gone and lost it all away.
Baba to $235 and I’ll never buy another China stock again ugh 🤦🏼‍♂️
Yes. Closed at 1300 today.
GME GANG COME ON
It's happening brother.  https://ibb.co/2gVMRFm What about you?

AAPL 🍏

MT pleas fly again
📢🗣️TIIIMM AAPPLE
Now
I cannot believe I quit AAPL and it only lasted one day before I am back.
Bad idea. Insider share lockup expires next week. More dumping ahead
Buying this PLTR dip, I am in until $40
march is long enough that you should definitely hold
Damn it feels good to sell at the fucking top
After one financial report
Still not what I meant to do. Even less so with all of it on margin.
1/8
Can anyone here actually explain the mechanism for how quantitative easing makes it into the markets?   All the FED is doing is buying treasuries from banks and shoring up their reserves. Their balance sheet goes up, but no money was created, it’s just a 1 for 1 swap. To create money the banks actually have to want to lend out, and even though their reserves are healthy due to QE credit is contracting and they don’t want to lend.   Can anyone explain how Japan has done this to a greater extent and still failed to create inflation, yet somehow we expect it?   Paging anyone with more than 3 braincells.
It just crushed the other day I think
Ok, as usual, awarding the daily thread means my positions end green EOD, esskeeeetitttt bois!!!
GME Some peeps bought the dip!🤑
Ok Jack  Take me to Tendy Town please
Is it time for 0DTE GMEs?
If you didn’t buy the baba dip, you hate money
HELL YES TATTOED CHEIF !!  I LOVE INVESTING IN AMERICAN 🇺🇸 COMPANIES   YEAH !!!   So happy Christmas Eve gonna make choco milk 🥛 😃😃😃😃
i remember *my* first week here
"Santa rally guys santa rally" fuck these ppl
TSLA's market cap briefly overtook BABA lel
RIP BABA call holders   Rejoice AAPL call holders
Merry Christmas 🛶  ,an early gift of coal.
Last December, China gave us COVID. This year, they decided to tank BABA
AAPL ath??
Maybe some ‘investors’ don’t want to wait till 2023 to see the first actual product roll off the assembly line......
Gme volume setting up for another ripper of a day
Was going to buy shares of BLNK ~a month ago when it was ~$8 a share, but held off. Sick to my stomach seeing it up to $48 this morning, fml need some rope
Pltr dead
GOEV has a little funny business going on with the price lol, some interesting bid/ask action but that’s what you get on a low volume day. Bought in literally half a second before the dip, thanks rh.
Simply having a terrible Christmas Time. Just kidding it’s wonderful
Merry Christmas to everyone except for Bitch McConnell, Nancy Pelosi, and the American government
# imagine panic selling AAPL and it does this the next day
BABA looking so joosy rn.
I regret putting a two factor authentication on robinhood. I don't need time to second guess myself.  If I lose it then so be it. Gotta input a code everytime I want to buy something
wait u fr
TIM👏TIM👏  TIM👏TIM👏TIM👏
FB bby no
Anyone got any good $ROPE recommendations. Looking at some double braid, twisted, or Nylon due to its stretch factor it’s looking like the most comfortable fit
til about Q2 2021 when they merge, dw it will go back up
That is true. But if figured we should go easy because Christmas.   BUT YOU KNOW? FUCK EM! FUCK EM FOR PLAYING GYNA STOCKS. MUHAHAHHAHS
BLNK 🥴🚀🚀🚀
Once again I should have played AAPL but didn't
Well at least NWARF is showing up in my account again. Although the valuation is still all fucked up
Net ready to pop off
That was funny indeed, thanks
I mean it’s just flat AF since that 10% jump last Tuesday.
Anyone looking at $VIAC ? I’m bullish on the investor day in early 21 it could be the same kind of event driven strategy as Disney Investor day except VIAC has a $20 B valuation. Paramount plus has a bigger streaming business than HBO max by more than double and Pluto TV HAS DOUBLED their revenue sequentially. Worth a look. I’m LONG AF and looking to size up given the growth prospects and I love streaming. Made a fortune on Disney Investor day hoping to double up with this VIAC investor day. This is still not well known as they only mentioned it at the UBS event two weeks ago.
F
Nah wait till it becomes BARK. What a great ticker
SQ died
Only a bit more and I am not down 10k
Don’t 👏forget that 👏 ICLN is a beast and is just starting with Biden
BABA bagholders crying
VLDR, LAZR, PLTR, GOEV and XL fucking me today.  TURN IT AROUND BOIS
XL to the moon
GME bulls said not today bitch
TEZLAGREEEEN
I bought that PLUG dip
The market can't close fast enough!
Thanks for the dip paperhands. Loaded up on calls!
Well they dont need to blindly follow just because hes been right/lucky for a while.  He isnt some kind of wsb prophet, just gives him a licence to pump and dump..
Not trying to flex or anything but I am now a proud owner of one share of $BABA
UK, EU agree post-Brexit trade agreement
TSLA hasn't done shit since in spy. Its needs to pump spy lets go
Santa's elves in shambles
Cheapest you’ll get imo. Last week at 25$ was the right time to buy the dip
That’s a spicy meatball!
Ban
Poooots!!!!!!
thank you for the cheap NIO for Christmas
let me tell you about a girl i know, she likes hip hop and rock nd roll
Already up thousand. I am sure it will close around 230 where I should be up about 5k

And it won’t be Camp Snoopie.
Please sell then.
all SPACs have a price floor of $10 so don't worry too much
My 🛶 is taking on water.
Bought STIC at 19.20 and it immediately died. Dont care because BECKY will take this thing to 50
GOEV giving me the middle finger for Xmas
I hope they paying you 2x
Haha...this....like, really? Of Tesla? Wow you're rolling deep.
GME $22 OR DIE TRYING
Yup. I used to pay for directvnow when it was $35. I've known about fubo tv for quite sometime now as I'm a cordcutting expert. Basically got everyone I know set up with the OTT stuff after I took the plunge about 5 years ago. Best investment I ever made. $2k a year in cost down to like $800 now per household. More $$ for stocks.
Idk why people even care about temporary dumps, every dip gets fuckin bought it doesn’t even matter
I'd go double braid, nylon didn't work for me
Who are they merging with
Would theta decay be an issue for a June-dated call?  The stock (HD) is up but my contract is losing value. I shouldn't have to worry about decay already should I?
Enough of the BABA posts alright. We all know jack ma is a certified vegetable, watch the video of him and Elon in a discussion.
where the fucj is apples top
TSLA pleas fly again
LGVW is absolutely ripping
Whenever I place a limit order that fills right away, I think to myself what a chump I am for paying retail.
How do you not hate yourself when you sell at +150% instead of waiting till +200%?
Bought some BABA just now on the dip.
I just sold some puts, so the worst thing that can happen is that the stock is below the strike price of my puts where in I'll have to buy back the stock at the strike price of my puts right?
Wtf  Im half asleep and didn’t think I saw that correctly
Haha. In light of BABA's decline, just trying to keep it light.
I changed my mind - bought some RMG.
That’s a pump and dump but PLTR is cool🤡😳
Andd Christmas is ruined this year
Oh no Pfizer babyyyy what you doing
This is clearly an over-reaction.  It's a probe, not an official lawsuit.  Google, Amazon, Facebook, MSFT, Apple all had a probe scare a few months ago....all at ATH right now.
MVIS wtf bro
GME making my nuts all tingly right now  🚀
GH IV GOING WILD
As predicted, America's tired of winning. Time to sell.
I've heard from waaaay too many people that CLDR sucks as a company, to invest in them
Xi did me a solid and my 1dte put made much moneys
BLNK 🚀
I think its linked to their supply issues. Their new processors and graphics cards in very short supply + the microsoft chip news having some impact as well.
GME! GME! GME!

Bruh this limp dick dorsey better fucking pump it with some news
CVS is a pump and dump
Blnk never stops giving lmao Can't complain
Took profits? You're on the wrong sub my friend
? Up like 7% on the week it’s an etf bro
What you guy looking at 1/8/21 245
It depends on if China really does start importing more steel. With commodities it's impossible to say because they always spike and dip, spike and dip
You may be color blind
baba deff gonna recover next coming weeks. This is one of those “it was so obvious why didn’t I buy the dip”
Mr. Supreme Leader of Great Nation China, I'm sorry for being disrespectful in the past, but can I have my money back?
I have $130 1/15.....but I paid 8.5 for it way back.  Not sure it can hit $140 by then.
Maybe vega

What's the news?
Mostly for GYNA holders   Which to be honest bruh   ...  U know the risk with GYNA companies... If u don’t u will learn very fast
Yeah that’s scary but tbh not a bad trading strategy. Short everything at open and sell like 30 sec later. This market is so fucked
&gt; ICLN  Personally think its overvalues now, had a good run up basically on Biden hype. If Dems don't take senate I'm not sure how much clean energy related spending he'll be able to get through the senate, chances are republicans gonna block it
All these contracts and pltr doesn’t do shit. What am I missing?
That’s good brother. I scalped the shit out of some prem in those first 10 min on puts
what is Cathie Wood doing with her BABA?
GME IS an ascended SUPER Stock ASCENDING🤑🤑🤑
Always buy the NET dips. My calls aren't in as bad a shape now. But I expect this gain to disappear on Monday.
Baba with the -$10k Christmas present. Commies hate Christmas I should have known better
Banks are getting flushed down the fucking toilet right now
Robinhood telling me the market closes at 1pm. What kinda second rate pos brokers are they
I shouldn't have sold my AAPL call for a shitty $200 gain.

GOEV with the dip, time to buy more calls

260%+    I just regret not buying more and not having cash at hand currently
Look up how many people have been hacked on RH and how long it takes them to actually help...you need 2FA, don't go without :O
Should I not FOMO into AAPL? Feel like I’ll get fucked if I buy 12/31 calls right now
Thank allah I bought that NIO dip

ITS HAPPENING PLTR TO THE MOON
Well I was hopeful since they just bought back a decent amount of shares from intel, but the price dropped like a rock at open.
JD is green. Fucking love it. Now BABA has to turn green......
Puts on RH for disabling our tendies
But it does close at 1

Was excited to see how much my covered calls were up this morning until I saw how much my positions were down to compensate.
TSLA running hop on
That NET dip yesterday was easy money.
why baba become kill?
Pushes interest rates down   Investors need yield   Portfolios skew more towards stocks
NVTA going on sale
No, wtf are you talking about.

Baba bears we eating today
You guys mad at Tesla for not moving, lol. Me and several other people said for weeks that when it joined the SP it was gonna behave more like a normal stock without the huge rips and dumps. Now you’re mad because it had a slow dip and isn’t ripping back up. I haven’t looked at it since last week but this might be its price for a while tbh
Pfizer makes viagra. That alone should make it go up
Would the CCP really kill one of their own like this? This looks like a yuge opportunity
ccp anti trust on baba
Luckily I didn't buy BABA and Tencent - while their shares are falling over China's antitrust concerns, my Pinduoduo (Ticker: PDD) is going up xD
I dream of my BNTX stocks coming back from the dip but idk if it will ever happen
picked up some 29C 0DTE near open...boy was I early. Thought my limit 0.23 was a good entry
wdym?
FCEL calls I bought this morning gonna pay for Christmas by eod

the good thing about my stocks tanking yesterday is that today they are green! Even if they are a few dollars less than yesterday still
Somehow I survived Xi Jinping's assassination attempt. I'm still alive and not doing too terribly

RMG is absolutely printing this week. Merger approval on Monday.
theyre selling for XL
Ibm
It has unbelievable strength that's for sure 👍
Record package volumes..still UPS FDX flat
Me and you both brother.
It's not like Luckin disappeared forever. They are available to be traded today if you wanted to invest in them. It's just the fact that for several months no one has any idea what happened to the company once it got delisted. While the chances of that happening with BABA are low, you just never know 100% with China. Baba is China's biggest and most valuable company and they are treating it like Kohls. I would not put limitation on what the Chinese government is or isn't willing to do. Fact is these oversea regimes can be brutal and unfair in the way they apply law.
They already did. Today just 1 million shorts need to cover. We are at about 1 million volume. Rest of the day flat or red.
CHWYYYYY YOU BASTARDS I TOLD YOU 115C 12/31
JFROG finally breakout
buying all the BABA puts I can. Think we have another 10% drop to go imo

The talk of santa rally for 2 weeks has been absolute bullshit
[removed]
Don't get why uts not pumping.   Either it will go up. Very solid company with high valuation and small amount of issued shares.  But yeah I was hoping for a hig run up
Wrong way xl
Disagree with this considering the sports gambling aspect they're working to implement. If I worked there, knew what was going on, I'd stay in.
What will mango lord tweet at 12:45 today I wonder?
Stimulus talks in shambles

BABA practices sound monopolistic to me, but maybe China doesmt actually care and is just doing this for show
Do it
Finally the pussies holding AMD stopped selling off. Go AMD, go!

GME finally broke through 21. See you at the moon boys.
*hits the contract a few times until it works*  There we go.
Alibaba more like Alibooboo
Lets go NET
Gimme rockets abnb I got calls to sell
Holy fuck BABA. Anyone else find it funny how when they announce the same investigations here it doesn't affect the tickers whatsoever yet when China does it they plummet because we all know China means business and it's less of an investigation and more of a "dicking down",
Cathie buying more BABA for the long hold
is it time to buy the AMD dip yet?
bought the PLTR sale, feeling good

I sold january 25Cs for like 3 dollars back in November 🤢🤢🤢
I guess Tesla heard people started buying puts
Buy the ICLN dip
Isn’t it tmrw
I wonder who are the motherfuckers that said: uh no, I don’t think Americans need 2k$
PLTR is my biggest disappointment :(
GME 15 EOD
use faceid
close them fam
hope u gotta stop loss because that thing went from 20-&gt;12 (about 40% drop) in 1-2 days.
TSLA back to its week high ladies. 670 by the 31st
So is this what the stock market looks like without mass manipulation?
So smart to buy after a huge cap drops that far in a day
TSLA just broke 650 here we go
Baba will be back at 250 in a month. Don’t care what CCP says. They won’t discourage foreign investment in China. Everyone wants tendies. Even communists
C'mon JD take advantage while BABA is in jail. Rise, RISE
i just wanted to hear from my friends and not some strangers article
I'm a triple retard... not only did I sell MRNA calls yesterday before the big rise missing out on 6k. I bought BLNK 1 days calls with it and then sold my BLNK calls for 500 bucks loss yesterday thinking it'd never recover... they would've instead net me a thousand bucks profit if I kept it till today
How do you sign up for the email alerts?
Isnt it supposed to be hibernation season?
AAPL pleas fly again
Damn I feel like that scene in big short trying to get my stimulus check.  “Give me my money. Give me MY fucking money, you mother fuckers”
GME might remain flat the rest of the day?
WHOA BABA
What is that Pacfic time
 🎅🎄🎁🎉
F is playing yoyo again. Dip bought!
PLTR recovered nicely.   You can go back to mooning now.
I'm at 14 average...gonna hold until the next pump
Only cocaine Mitch
Yeah bought some shares at 226 just a small amount. don't have a previous position in BABA. Betting its gonna be a slap on the wrist and BABA recovers by 30-40% next couple of months
Unban u/SIR_JACK_A_LOT ya wankers.
Fucking guy betrayed us.  Held shares, posted positions in STIC and made a killing when us tards made it shoot up 20%  What u expect

Changes in certification exams (Solar winds security updates and new training classes) re-examinations coming up, needs new courses. Pluralsight is fairly common and used in tech and non tech industry.  My DD has been hearing people at the dog park the PMP exam changing and needing to sign up at HR a bunch of people for courses at Pluralsight. So I started looking into it...after 5 minute of in depth research, my retard brain said buy.   So I bought calls on PS and also holding onto GME  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  and PLTR  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀
Everytime I want to make a purchase on desktop, I get asked. Never happens on phone though

Anyone else hate trading? I make okay money doing it but I just can’t stand it
I don't quite get why it is trading so high I thought it would be like a long term investment but I am actually so tempted to sell now
Ban
1 blnk and its up get it ? hahaa..
big green cock on my screen
Man of his caliber deserves to start a little early
People really tried to make ICLN red 😂  It’s literally free money
everything's up. I don't think you picked the only one.
its been floating around 27-29 for the past week. why would you sell at the median thinking its the bottom? 🤡
The worse thing is that the stock plummets significantly below your break even price (which is lower than your strike price due to the premium you receive), and you start you new position of X x 100 shares down.   You can always buy it back if things go very against you.
Ugh why did I buy GOEV
Probably those foreign countries that where getting more stimulus than us
I’m kind of thinking the same, scoping out the option chain at the moment
I've got 40k to put in gme. Already put 20k in. Hesitant to put too much because we're up so much past few days
So, of last note, if vix rises but spxs only bumps up a little, no big deal, probs a little sell off is coming. However, if both start going vertical together, means shit is about to hit the fan. However, if both nose dive, it's a strong indicator that we're entering into a bull market

Guys, I know the market closes at 1. Take a joke you autismos lmao fuck
Yeah, based on their past antitrust "investigations" it could mean just about anything, just not anything that's based on the actual "law" on the books, which introduces massive uncertainty. Could end up being nothing or having some totally bizarre outcome. Not surprised to see the price fall this much.

I’ve never gotten a Christmas gift in my life, but if pltr could hit 30🥺🥺
*making a ton of money
I have a bunch of shares, not buying further for now.  I know they have massive supply issues with their new graphics cards and processors so likely Q4 numbers won't be amazing.
tf, what a shitty a call to diversify...
Lots of hype in EV and charging stocks

RKT doing what RKT does.. bleh.

Selling covered calls is the best. If it stays at 29 all year I will still triple my money.

It's already dropped an unreal amount for how big of a market cap it's got. It's more likely to flatline or bounce up then drop another 10%.plus iv has spiked already I'm sure

Totally agree. Buying at the top because someone here told me so.
 I got scared when the OP got banned lol so I kept a tight sell order as it was rising this morning

Agree, and thank you for posting. TDAmeritrade updated ThinkOrSwim so that the "NYSE closes in" ticker accurately reflects the early closing time today. We should remind all the autists every time there is an early closing.

No.  I hate the thought I’ll be working when I’m 65 years old.  When I get my inheritance, which God willing won’t be for years to come, I’ll be less degenerate with my trading, but I won’t be sticking that shit into SPY and praying it goes up enough for me to retire at 65 either.
Dont even think about it SQ
I'll just cry it's fine
If these 1 month out IWM puts fail to work again I’m going to close out all my big Dick gains and buy 100k of ours because this thing ripped 50 bucks without looking back once.
Pluralsight is legit a staple of the tech industry, and more and more schools are integrating it into lesson plans. Could definitely see it having a huge future impact, but doubling price seems almost unlikely for a company that trains new skills and still somehow went down during covid.
Should I sell my AAPL calls that are up pretty big right now for more ICLN calls? Or keep both?
SQ has support at 231 , buying the dip seems like a smart play
You’d be a supertard to not buy leaps on an etf
GOEV cannot seem to find a bottom yet
Reminder: GOP rejected 2k stimmy because they r 🐻s and democrats wouldn't let go of foreign aid. Both parties do not care so you shouldn't either, just worry about stonks  ICLN 🚀🚀🚀

One would think, if China wants to topple Amazon and America, Baba is the best avenue.

agreed homie, merry fucking christmas!
Gme bullish!
$FROG!
I think it’s way overvalued for now, but it’s a speculation stock, they could keep rising for a month straight, which BLNK has done, or tumble very fast. BLNK somehow recovered from the last dump and went even higher, pretty crazy
Can it really say that
Need more volume
Will you guys give it a break on hyping PLTR. Its catching hella resistance at the 29-30 range and will not break out until  A. They secure substantially more contracts  B. Prove some worth with vaccine dist.  I’m not saying to sell off. Just don’t expect those Oct style gains again for a little bit. If it can break out I think it goes to around $40 ish.
BABA tanks enough I’ll just buy damn leap calls, the risk/reward is worth the YOLO knowing this thing is damn undervalued in an overvalued stonk market.
GME staying above 20 now?
Picked up calls at 1.40% down, sold at .70% down a few moments ago.   I don't know how much more of a spike we're going to get.
Nobody is as dumb as I was today. After PM discussions with a fellow retard, I thought it would be a good idea to bet on the veto-proof defense bill being passed by investing in a couple defense stocks. I figured that they wouldn't tank once mango vetoed since they were veto proof and were being forced through on Mon or Tues. Jan 8 calls on those companies actually, shockingly (but not really now that I think about it) tanked this morning and fucked an otherwise flat day for my "portfolio" (although that word sounds too professional for what I have.   Thinking about selling and starting over once I finish reading a few books on how to not be a dumbass in the stock market.
BB gonna pop
Imagine how much money the Market Makers have made off Palantir since IPO: repeatedly teasing the stock, forcing it down by shorting or dumping, then allowing hope as it trades tantalisingly below 30 for days on end.      SMH...
BB on a 60s moon mission with a monkey at the wheel
Calls on Bob Lazars ufo
Don’t be a pussy. You should really get 12/31 22c all $40,000!
Just loaded up on GH.I. V Jan $15c LETS GO
Imagine being a bulltard and cheering on central bankers as they sell out your generation to preserve the status of boomers. Wake up sheeple.
I mean everyone here has 25k accts? Never heard of this shit before
I think she is talking about the 150 mili going to some gay museum that’s shut down for COVID restrictions
Time to roll out into some leaps I guess
Should've sold on that pop I'm fucking down big too
Pltr keeps breaking my heart but I can't let let it go
amzn is literally a fucking piece of shit
If you were looking at my portfolio, you would think the market was crashing lol i suck
I have set a price target of 100 for GME by February 2021. Won’t take any further questions at the time
i bought 10k worth at $294... still bag holding  🤡
BABA Cash Flowing into AAPL...  $140+ Monday.
Christ he is one of us, which state retard? Are you in DC or some bumfuck town in Nebraska?

So is stimulus hope still alive after Republican block the 2k check, and Trump doesn't want to sign the $600 bill?
I love SPYD
All the homies got GME
If we make believing in GME a religion. 100  EOY🤑🤑
I bought $500 worth to FDs on BABA at close yesterday. They be worth over $35k if I bought puts 🤡
I’m in.  Put a limit order in for an ITM LEAPs and it filled
Happens a lot post merger.
All I want for Christmas is ARK weekly options

I wanna buy BABA today. What do we think about that
I hope that fucking bill had a provision in it to MAKE DJ HORNS ILL-FUCKING-EAGLE I FUCKING HATE THOSE MOTHER FUCKING THINGS
AMD fucking please bro  I have a family 😭

Look at PTON go.
BABA leaps down 30%+ so tempted
Brexit finished. Is this bullish or no impact
I could see this bleeding for days to come...but who knows.
When it rocket to $30,$40
Arizona
I'mma throw a few zeros at this BABA dip. Anyone else with me?
BFT BUY NOW THIS SHITS GOING TO $16 NOT STOPPING
I don’t know what to do with my hands
$35/share in one day? Surely that's an overreaction. Baba already stated they would operate as normal, and will comply with all regulations. People acting like it's going bankrupt or something. This is mind blowing
so what you're saying is if i had just got the coronavirus i wouldn't have tasted all this shit i'm eating on these 12/24 calls
got in on the BABA sale, if I get burned I will never invest in another chinese company again
ICLN is back. Fuck the bitches
no stim checks at all as of rn
VLDR 🪐🚀
Feliz noche buena and feliz navidad to all my autistic latinX traders 🥴🤶🥴
Worst day ever for BABA
Your guess is as good as mine!

Chinese EV bends the knee to XI.  No worries there.
Im in it to win 🍉
Cleared out my winning positions for tax purposes (I got waxed being a bear in April/May), looking for some shares to hold. This NVTA dip looking nice
I would exit any baba positions ASAP!
SH.IP is being pump and dumped again rn. I’ve been bag holding for forever
you did, but it's going in for another scoop
Why did Ivanka settle for jared kushner? there is no way he has a big dick
UK EU trade deal done!
Shit stock, shit products
Just went full send on a daily BABA put at $220. Banking on my inability to time a top and a bottom.
 went all in GME today without realizing im out of day trades.. how fucked am i?
I would cream
How the fuck did you lose 10K already its barely 10 AM
Should I YOLO $45k on GME?
AMD pleas fly again
GO RMG GO!
Being poor sucks, can't take profits on 2 calls I bought at open cuz PDT
You got a small pp
Because it's a shit stock.
Tsla ripping
BABA$   Man this is getting ruff now man   A painful lesson to investing in GYNA stocks    Shit I have seen so many in my 14 year trading career
i’m so confused, my TSLA 675 call is still at a big loss yet the price of TSLA is increasing?
Where’s the volume This morning
Would be nice, it's fucking drilling.
Pltr is gonna make me wait until next week to lose more money
Ok boomer. Let’s fire up the coal burners instead.
Oh it was overvalued at like 30... but this company only has a market cap of 1.4bil so it's easily pumped and dumped. I bought at 6... so my logic was fuck it just hold it for couple years
Santa rally canceled this year?
Holy hell BABA. And I was debating jumping in at $260.
I’m deep in APPL and adding more weekly.  APPL should be 200
GAN🚀🚀🚀
Iborrow desk only have 4K shortable shares for GME. Hold!
I’m convinced RKT doesn’t want any shareholders the way it’s moving
All in tsla it's back
Dude what?! Its amazing if you actually make it from scratch. Come on now!
Paper hands gang 😔😔
THC-B the only thing keeping me up today and it looks like that is about to dump too
Daily reminder that PLTR has never, not once, turned a profit.
You drug your knuckles last night and are now bag holding, look at the volume.  I bought Ah at 15.80 sold at 18.90 this morning.  You have to be a LOT faster on these types of plays, you will learn.
TSLA 700 EOD
What’s your strike?
No impact probably good that it’s over but Britain is a non factor cuz they’re poor
Did that post talking about S T I C get deleted yesterday? Can’t find it anymore
how do we feel about MARA
I’m out at 18. The volume right now is fucking insane. Pump pump pump
You finally gave my portfolio the killing blow. Thanks CCP
I feel baba could either be an amazing rebound play or it could go down to 150. Don’t fuck with the ccp
MOON MISSION LOADED FOR BIG FUCKING TENDIES

what is the play?
real talk, is this a good opportunity for some Baba LEAPS?
Where is the BABA loss porn? European markets aren't even open. There is more coming. Lmao
Can I just remind everyone that fuck snapchat?
May be a good opportunity to spend some more margin on it next week.
Going to work for a start up. This IPO money is insane. Screw working for the government
Feeling increasingly stupid for continuing to hold NIO Mar 18 $50c. Nio day better be worth it.

Well, it is definitely true what people were saying yesterday. Volume is real low.   Only the most degenerate fucks are trading today 🤣

Yes
You buying this dip?

Its true tho
IV and theta brother... welcome to options
Wow. Be nice or selling my my 2500 shares of GME
PDD
Today it didn’t even try to fake pump for the first 5 min
The thesis for gme is that its a hold. Buy some put spreads or soemthing if your scared
GOP is the one who scrubbed...
How much would clean energy pull back if GOP wins Georgia? Or how much would XOM go up? Place your bets
Dead cat bounce Baba?
Damn that’s a pretty amazing return
Communism just seized your portfolio 💼🌈🐻📉
I trust you, you sound like a dick expert.
TSLA easily closing 670+ get in
For BABA yeah lmao
Tesla moon mission
hey jack ma, go fuck yourself
I can smell the fear 👃
my 1/8 132 calls are getting mixed emotions bro
this is well documented. they were both HELLA weird in NYC, and kind of fell for each other because few others were as mutually self-centered and deviantly autistic.
((()))
It's china. If Xi wants BABA will be nationalized and jack man will come out and say it's a great idea.
Shares
Imagine losing money in BABA rather than making it in JMIA 🥴
30 minutes to lose 7%, new record!
How do you buy AH wizard

Perfect opportunity to buy more.
Reinfections are common given the opportunity [[1]](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/khsw6u/scientists_urge_concern_not_alarm_over_new_virus/ggo8qir/). Reinfections can be used to estimate anti-body half life for anti-bodies created by the vaccine. [[2]](https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/antibody+half-life). Reinfections can also be used as an indicator for B cell immunity, as B cell immunity created via a infection is the same as B cell immunity created by a vaccine. [[3]](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html). Yes, vaccines do provide a greater initial antibody count than a natural infection, but the anti-body half life is the same and short as indicated by reinfections. Bi-annual vaccine boosters are not logistically feasible.  If antigenic drift reduces efficacy rapidly, its a problem. Its not possible to vaccinate for multiple versions bi-annually. [[4]](https://twitter.com/trvrb/status/1340409968818671616?s=20). "Immune Evasion" can already be seen occuring in the South African strain [[5]](https://sciencespeaksblog.org/2020/12/22/covid-19-south-african-variant-may-be-worse-than-uk-variant/).

Ebay is legit trash
Damn who went all in on baba puts and is now a millionaire?
New to this. I put in an order for ICLN $31C 4/16 like 10 min ago on RH. is that going to go through today?
Fuck Chinese companies, Tesla it is.
Look at his profile. He said he would hold till merger.
[removed]
Yeah exactly that haha.  I'm betting slap on wrist and bought a small position at 226. Let's see.
That was an arranged marriage
Does everyone here have 25k accounts so they can day trade or am I missing something
GOEV is GOEVing the wrong way.

You’re retarded
Welcome back Tesla
Honestly
good to know. thanks!

Pltr a mean mistreater
Buy General Motors calls. Not kidding, that shit is undervalued and dipped 2% this morning.
More like diamond hands pussy
any dips to buy for monday? i have 7k profits to put somewhere
When do they vote for 2k?
No a few days ago
fuck baba fuck China
Sold out of baba shares for $500 loss  I was literally thinking of selling yesterday. Fml
BABA is doing some impressive shit. Up 50% YTD to nearly flat. I'm in at 215 if it actually goes to flat
just keep a close eye on it for a few days lol. hopefully it gains a lot of cushion

Had a neighbor about 20 years ago with a HAM radio and a huge antenna off the back of his house.   I discovered this when, one morning while I was in bed sleeping, I heard through my unshielded PC subwoofer some *loud* country dude talking suddenly.  Startled me out of bed.
281 gang here  13 shares gang
Fedex only goes down. Glad I cut losses on my Jan 270 calls honestly even tho that was my safest strike 🪧
No
Dems, GOP, Crazy Socialists, and Mango Diehards putting on Xmas theatrics on stimmy.  “We have a deal for stimulus!”  “I want $2,000 for every American!”  “Ok, we will call your bluff. We will put something on House floor.”  GOP blocks it and they put their own bill. Dems block it.  Now no one is getting shit.
never investing in chinese stocks again
CCCP can kind of do whatever they want, right?    If they want to ruin Jack Ma to teach Chinese Oligarchs to stay in their lane they will.
Imagine making money 🥴
Nio being gay   salesforce me off   about to pull out of both and throw it at STIC
GME guy said he’s holding STIC till merger. He also said he wants to 2x-5x his money.
Anyone else buying the BABA dip??
It’s out there man
🚀🙌🏻
Lmao how are you losing money on AAPL. Buying puts?? Because if so you’re a madman
Sell calls from a different strike to lock in profit
Quick, I'm FOMO'ing with yesterday gains, FSR, GRWG, or IIPR best stonk for  autistic returns???
You call sell the calls for Same date that are above.   Like if you have AAPL 12/31 $140c you can sell AAPL 12/31 $145c (just made those numbers up).   It works because the $140 fills the $145 if it goes ITM. so you can do that at the top to kind of harvest from loss when you think it’s peaked during the day
apex🚀🚀🚀
TSLA 💸💸💸
If u had invested in BABA at any time this year, u would have lost money. What a massive dip... My condolences.
yeah it's been fucking insane I should probably just sell it but I'm retarded
TSLA volume actually looking real good imo, you bagholders might see a decent pump today but don’t expect the 10% days of the past
Same
nice dip on CFII. Loading
Can FCEL please drop like 20% today? K that'd be great.
Perfect opportunity to buy some monthlies though, this thing should fly in Q1
Why is Tesla ripping?
Tendies!!!!
Hope so. Sold some puts at 240 for 12/31 and 1/15 a while ago.  If it stays sub 240 I may end up balls deep in baba
my portfolio is more of a means of destruction rather than production tbh
AAPL keeps teasing a break out. Just fly already
[removed]
Yo! Just said that below. Absolutely
Then don’t cry when the ponzi party is over
$ROPE
so even if tsla is much higher today it’s gonna stay like this? the price rn is higher than when i placed my call
Got in a small stock position earlier this week. Do you know much about it?
Losing faith in PLTR :(
Neither did Tesla until this year
all I want for Christmas gme 22.35
welcome to options
the fuck is a put spread??? i just saw some  🚀🚀🚀 in a thread and went all in  ###
Remember when you were a kid and dug a hole some boomer would say you were digging to China?  Apparently Chinese boomers say the same thing and baba is digging to America.
If GOEV could fucking GO already that would be great
Hey Santa, wake the fuck up and give me some damn tendies
Big money interests need GME under $21 today
For real though why has Merkel been chancellor for what seems like 20 years?  It’s like her and Putin and subtly trying to outlast eachother
im drowning with you brother
They are a piece of shit company
I DONT WANT ALOT FOR CHRISTMAS  THERE IS JUST ONE THING I NEED  DONT CARE ABOUT THE PRESENTS  PLTR 30C
Pump and dump
Baba really going on free fall
Got my hand on the trigger. $30,000 YOLO on GME. Is the short squeeze finna happen today? Share price just trading sideways and I dunno what to do. OGs please help.
Yo you work for the government? Could you put in a word with the big man
Really want to long Krispy Kreme
Someone tell Santa to take his rally and blow it out his ass
Calls are so stressful
Knew I should've bought the pdd pre market dip!! A caution retard is a stupid retard
If not for this BABA would have been a good entry. Now no one knows
Not trying to get political but: #CONGRESS IS SO FUCKING FULL OF SHIT, FUCK THESE PEOPLE, FUCKING THROWING 600 BUCKS OURR WAY AND MAKING TRUMP SEEM LIKE THE BAD GUY. FUCK ALL OF THEM LEFT, RIGHT, CENTER
If Jack Ma would have kept his big mouth shut for a few more days, none of this would have happened. No wonder he was denied admission to Harvard 10 times.
Going to pick up BABA when it drops below $100
There are lots of stop losses that are going to be triggered at the open.
Honestly you get what you deserve for putting your trust in China 🇨🇳
The price has probably gone up since then and it didn't go through. RH has shitty fills, you gotta keep trying at the current price
Hopefully it’s not LK 2.0
Biiiiig Fucking Tendies today boys! All aboard!
Haha...cya there!
MT pleas print
🚨PLTR forming double bottom 🚨
Fuck it shut it all down. Not like gov does anything productive anyway

Okay but legit ICLN calls are free money
Getting real tired of my PLTR :(
Just added my $10k

I say give it another 1.5 hrs. IT'll be highest then.

680 end of day easily
I'm thinking of writing up a new post, a 1 Year, 100% ROI Challenge sort of thing. I'm pretty confident I could achieve it with a small account, and teach people a lot about options/trading in the process. What do yall think?
Bro sports gambling is not happening before 2022. This market is so regulated it has nothing to do with streaming anymore. Insiders know fubo is very low on cash, look at their balance sheet. This may lead to secondary offering. Of fucking course insiders will sell after a 400+% runup
Umm added some march 250C.
And MMs fucking with stuff with no resistance lol
Bought BABA “dip” 🤡📉
GME pls say sike
The way it’s been trending I do think so. However, I bought 4/16 because I think with Joe Budden coming into office will moon the ETF even higher. That green deal is juicy
when yates is pumping fcel so hard on twitter you just know you gotta be careful
man tried to get in on some tsm 0dte calls and it didn't fill before that shit took off, fuck me for not getting in on the ask price i guess
Bought some 2/19 Calls on BABA, am I crazy?
I don't get the allure of barkbox maybe it's because I'm not a dumb basic bitch. I can see retard strength pushing the price up though
How high is TSLA going today?
She's into chicks, not dicks.
RMG RMG RMG RMG RMG 🚀🚀🚀🚀😍
Teslllaaaaaaaa 🚀 EOD?
BABA$ dude !!   🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
bro they are recalling 600k trucks. Going to dip further before it rebounds
Markets might as well be closed today with this volume.... damn I’m bored
Negative
I wouldn't even trust it then.
TSLAAAAAAAA
Nah fuck that, it would make the price action much more volatile, these are steady gainer ETF's  Just find your favorite ARK, find the top 5 holdings, then out of those pick the ones you want to buy weeklies on  Problem solved
#DELIST ALL CHINESE SHIT
Sold 1 at the last pump for $570. 1 more for 💎🖐

I made $2100 on SPX calls in 5 minutes at open.  Now time to get drunk the rest of the day.
Bruh BABA 💀
LAZR?
Tell me why I shouldnt buy Baba leaps right now
Their stock sucks ass I see the company everywhere and they torched earnings. But the stock is just fucking terrible
Long term hold. Waiting on the January partnership announcement
Mods! Oh wait.. Go on sir..
1/8/21 baba?
Why is PDD up biggy today?
ToS allows unlimited trades with a cash account (no margin).
Sorry guys I bought AMD, it’s only going down now
Rip baba, too red for christmas
PLTR 30 COME ON
This sell off is so gay
Fuck no I wanted to buy at $280 but so glad  I didn't pull the trigger. China lies cheats and steals like no other, fuck them and I feel bad for Chinese bagholders this could end bad.
Reminder that Kelly Loeffler is married to the chair of the NYSE and actively trades on info from intel meetings. Prostitutes should not comment on other peoples' sex lives.
Playing it safe and buying shares
When were you wen BABA die?
its alrdy been rejected  [https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/24/house-votes-on-2000-stimulus-checks-after-trump-supports-them.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/24/house-votes-on-2000-stimulus-checks-after-trump-supports-them.html)
TESLA? IS THAT YOU OVER THERE?
will meade twitted that mara filed for stock offering. i read couple days ago
I don't think staying in BABA is the best play. CCP already stopped ANT's IPO and has not been afraid to flex on businesses. Also, the market is already hot with JD and PDD gaining market share in that space. It's a little different than AMZN's market dominance in the Western Hemisphere; who's actually using WMT or COST's online shopping in the major markets?
most of the DOW is down. a risky (but potentially lucrative long hold is ba)
Oh no my weekly is expiring worthless how did i not see this coming
You wanna fuck w the CCP dawg?

If you buy 30000 worth of shares your gonna bump the price a bit and that should make people happy, but what do I know
Can't spell "damn I hate money" without A-M-D
Not necessarily... TSLA would just have to make a monumental move today for you to make a profit.
Not likely to happen today. Low vol and markets closing early
Then you’re fine..the play is Q1
It definitely has more room to drop. All it takes is another news article from China and it drops another 10%. I'm probably going to wait until it seems like this China stuff blows over.
Fed suing them for opiates, such a joke.
HOW THE FUCK IS BEST BUY DOWN EVERY MOTHER FUCKING DAY
Yeah I am. I wouldn't mind a pull back to 18 or so I'd load up.
Brexit is over, they just agree on a deal

Just buy shares and sit tight
BABA 2022 40p look so fucking tempting @ .27
False. I made $251 the first time I traded PLTR. I then proceeded to lose over $500 by continuing to trade it, but that’s neither here nor there.
GME 1/15 $18P?
wtf is with baba
Thinking about gme puts to inverse y’all. Is the market open tomorrow?
U.K. Trade Deal = DONE.   We MOONING.  AAPL $140+ Monday.
Haha all the idiots on here bought AMD instead of TSM. TSM is a billionaire maker stock
last time ****FCEL**** will be at this price. This dip buy is a must if you like money
Its not Ma Ma's fault. He's being picked on by the ccp
Fuck ya -14.5k on BABA calls    Merry Christmas  🖕

finally nikola is where it belongs... $GOEV seems undervalued right now...
Do you think ICLN is going to have a proper dip or just keep moving? I imagine going forward clean energy is the move.      Currently contemplating getting into a couple of stock positions vs options.
turn them into spreads and close on monday open
Su Bae is doing the dominatrix thing to me right now and I don't like it at all

Imagine selling naked puts of baba 🥴 couldn’t be me

Is BABA gonna be okay?  I have 30 shares now cause I avg down but honestly still a little nervous for the long term
buy the FEYE dip  also probably BABA idk
This year I've made a little over 7k, going from 10k to 7k. I dont even wild plays like post of you. It's been an insane year. Looks like I can go on a road trip to the grand canyon during the summer now
Cathie no buy more BABA pleas
Here for you bro. You’ll come back from this. I believe in you!

yo I bought BABA at 278... Wtf is going on 😭😭😭
Well this was anticlimactic   I was told we would have a Christmas rally 😡
TESLA LFG!!!!
Based
Wsb won’t even touch baba right now. This is how you know it’s a good buy
So what
Who bought X last week👏🤣
Best thing about getting older is that the tendies stay the same age
GME making me go worse than limp. My shit inversing at this point.
They have a massive recall right now on faulty seat belts. Lowest rates truck for 2021.   Don't forget the other huge recall for suspension.
If you like losing money
Never touching China again lol
I lost 7k on BABA and counting.  Time to double down!
Averaging down on OPEN yesterday is paying off a little 🙏🏼
Positive.
$33 potential?
That's worth some YOLOING.
Thank you. Appreciate the super fast reply and advice.
Yuppp
Yeah this is at a discount
No reason but I lost money
Lmfao. Sounds about right. You gotta have a country accent real or fake to talk on there or else they shit on you. My neighbor has the biggest ham radio set up in the world. Basically a cell phone tower. Talks all over the world. That’s too nerdy for me lol but when I’m on a long road trip the CB is fun.
BABA 🩸🩸🩸
Better hurry up gay, it’s on sale today!
Holy shitttt APEX LEGENDS ASSEMBLE
If I made a bunch of gains this year is it better to cash out before the new year or after
SQ is setting up to blast here after testing support twice 🚀🚀
Watch TSLA soar like an eagle’s bountiful wing, bringing X-mas cheer to all with diamond hands!
Tesla bringing up s&amp;p500
Please fly again CRSR
I don’t think American investor understands that when CCP GOVERMENT fucks with u   It’s not like here in the USA where google and Facebook get probes every Monday and pay and fine and tell em to fuck off    Na bro   XI wants more control and he will get it
If my crayon holds out don't jump in until around $18
oh my BABA
BABA Snorlax needs to wake the fuck up and do some damage already fuck Christ sake.
That option is literally in the money wtf don’t worry you’ll be making money soon. Apple is an EV company now it can trade at 750x earnings
Perfect balance of green and red for Christmas
I believe it will happen sometime between now and mid January. YOLO is the way.

The single TSLA share I bought for 640 this morning is the greenest thing in my portfolio

GOEV, this does not spark joy.

Thanks for the heads up. Imma wait till Monday. Weekends scare me.
Hey ARK can we pick a direction and STICK TO IT
TTM SCALPER  ALERT 📢 ⚠️ 🚨 📢 ⚠️
Retards not realizing today is the lowest volume day all year of course movements gonna be weird
Goddamn, it's about time you learned your lesson.
Fuck yes I bought the dip
Alright alright alright
Hold
it’s sending a message, to BUY
Yes. Xi is gonna fuck you.
I’ll be waiting lol
3.5hrs?
Do y'all think BABA will be under $220 today?
10k down on baba shares 🤡🤡
I bough it at 78 and I wish I would've sold at 319. jfc!
China lies cheats and steals like no other fuck them. And fuck them for the corona. Yes I'm blaming China!!! Fucking up my Christmas....
What am I missing here? I know it boomed but I see a paper tiger. I don't know why people see it stabilizing over $20
Icln, arkk, arkg, qqqj
Baba leaps even for 270s are dirt cheap  Can’t really see why I wouldn’t
# baba testing march lows
Lmao I made back almost all my losses on baba buying puts at open.  Fuck you China, never touching that again
So...not leap calls
Trade that stalk
All aboard the FUBO train last chance to get on. This will be at 100 in next two months once they announce content deals and sports betting
picked up a 1/15/22 35c on that ICLN dip
CRSR calls good idea?
I'm not trying to argue for the Trump presidency, I am simply saying congress is so fucking shit they give us crumbs like fuckin feudal lords and we are nothing, I don't think that opinion warrants a mod response as I would assume 99.999999% of the people here can agree with that.
Anything down today that’s a good buy ?
my total return is $5 like do i just take that or let it sit and risk it tanking
#”CHINESE AMAZON” 🤡🤡🤡
MT pleas fly again. we need a thots and prayer thread
gl. I bought a LEAP and a Jun to DD
its not a weekly play, its a yearly play  its up 3x already and everyone keeps saying its a long term play
The year is 2023. I open Reddit and hit News. The top post: *BREAKING* Stimulus talks COULD come to a vote IF a vote is decided to allow a vote for the Stimulus vote.
Whatcha mean?
Long game so don’t worry friend
Apex too ducking gapped up
What are you positions?
Bullish

Jack Ma getting dunked on by the CCP I’m sure Elon is happy
Got in @ $18, will hold for awhile.
Now it moving now lol
market is a bit boring today, money will be a full casino right?
added more Pltr calls. They can’t keep you red. Flying again soon
Any one buying this baba dip?
Fuck all you TSLA doubters. We’re going to 700 bitches!
Imagine not buying NET yesterday
jack ma...you son of a bitch
How do you know?
1/15 30C
It’s gonna skyrocket next week tho
At +1% not even an hour into the day?
Because they’ll be even cheaper in a few more weeks
trying so hard not to buy this baba dip  i really should wait til next week
FCEL is the chosen one HUGE BATTERY conference with the big boys Jan 16th
Is ABML still a play?
If that money is on shares, go for it.
I’m not a believer in max pain but total volume of call contracts that have been sold went up about 10x is this week.  It won’t stop the rocket, but it can slow it down... also it’s up an amazing amount in a short time.  I have faith.
Ya I got about the opposite of good play on them. Bought some slightly out of the money calls 30 to 45 days out (this was around thanksgiving/first of December) and they have dropped like 20% as a stock in that time. 100% loss on the options.  Great news hits my TV, their stock drops. I can't figure it out
Lisa for the love of god you need to get it together
This shit is retarded. Rallying for nothing like always. Goes up on stimulus hopes, then unmoved when nothing happens.
Sold puts yesterday 🤕
Bought STIC at the absolute top 🥴😤
No day trades and I really don’t want to get into anything before EOD so. Probably just gonna close out
GOEV calls 🤡🤡🤡
BB BOUNCE BACK
yolo man, i get 3k loss reduction a year
Now that it’s in the s&amp;p, I’m gonna be more careful About blindly following Tesla. It’s been good to me, but index is gonna mess up that good bread
Welp. Sold baba at open and bought msft. That's an american play right?
Yes
Not poor enough to get poor people stimulus checks, not rich enough to get rich people hand outs :/
Proof? I don’t doubt it I just want to feel better about my baba call options loss
What time the market close today??
Yeah I just saw it on RH but I can see how it can be easy to miss
TSLA diamond hands 🙌
MERRY XMAS TARDS, AUTISTS, PSYCHOPATHS AND LADIES!!!  May your portfolios 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀to the 🌑.   YOLO on your stonks and take your 🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑 and TENDIES home.   You still have 4.5 days to make back your six figure losses.
Well not massively, but people here have orgasms when a firm puts 50k I to something
You're fine then. Hold those fuckers until the PDT rule no longer applies to you, Boss.
Just found out that the COVID stimulus bill had a clause on extending federal tax credit on solar installations.  They better deal with this immediately cause I need these OTM TAN weeklies to PRINT

who bought STIC at the top?  &amp;#x200B;  fuck WSB retards holy fuck lol, learn to find good SPACs at $10 yourself instead of getting pump and dumped
where
People here do not talk about fraud enough. On every bit of news or post we see, there is the risk that its an out n out lie. Right not now you might have a BS filter that works, but the liars will only get more sophisticated
Serious question, why would baba drop more (13%) here than in China (8%), aren’t they the same company and aren’t we going off of their news?
You could push it a little further out to February so you can play the earnings runup a bit more? That’s the call I have at least, it’s been going crazy lately though I did buy a couple weeks ago. I think you might be fine though, next week should be another good week for AAPL, assuming stimulus talks don’t go terribly. They should have more to run with new products, EV hype, potential that they’ll smash earnings with iPhone sales
SPACs are ripppin
Betting against the CCP...       Good luck

QS 🚀🚀🚀 !!!!!
If all you retards think BABA is doomed just look at FB and GOOG that has similar lawsuits going on and in US unlike fake Chinese lawsuits. Algos will get you all so bad if everyone jumps in puts for BABA.  It’s AAPL of China and is up these in the big leagues. One anti trust law suit doesn’t mean their printers will turn off at all. Come next reporting period and it go brrrrerrrrr.
Legit question: How do you guys keep hindsight bias in check? I'm constantly doing it as a newer investor.

nope!
BABA aint shit unless it goes (%20)
Republicans on Thursday rejected Democrats’ long shot effort to add $2000 stimulus checks to the $900 billion stimulus package after President Donald Trump threatened to veto the legislation unless Congress increased the direct payments, throwing the passage of the aid deal into peril just days before the government is set to shutdown, and unemployment checks for millions of Americans run dry.   FUCK AMERICA POLITICS   FUCK THESE 80 YEARS OLD CONGRESS  JUST DIE ALREADY!!!   This is my Christmas spirit 🎄 🎁
Sir jack alot has been BANNED for promoting PUMPS AND DUMPS
Lady, I don’t even know what a SPAC is
pleas fly again
I’ve top tier plays with MGNI calls, PERI calls, and BABA puts. My next magic trick is PLTR calls. Shorts will begin to unwind their positions this next week and we will break 30

What are your positions?
I guess, I’m just riding this 1 call i have left. It expires 1/8 although it does look kinda good now . might take the small profit

SPACs are dead? Tell that to RMG 😎
It's China that launched the suit
Bottom for GME? Seems to have a a lot of support at 20.6
Ok so fuck this market. I’m out. Have a good one
I traded some BA calls &amp; stonks on the morning bounce to the tune of \~$600 profit.   So, because I believe the next month until the Trump transition risk poses understated risk, I dumped the $600 into 1/22/21 IWM deep OTM puts.   Let's see if the tail risk bet pays off for me : )
Wrong answer. you really think the answer is in letters “Google” and not a time smh
Or cash account.
[removed]
It’s one step up, two steps down, three steps up, etc
Because 1. Chinese investing culture is different. 2. The state media in China reports differently than US corporate media
the trend is your friend
Nicely done! From only stocks, what did you buy into? Tsla? Visiting the grand canyon has been my dream for years
Wrong way, APHA.  🤬
Fuck 😮
ARKK just doesnt have red days
Well we are off to a fucking nice start this Christmas Eve. With any luck the early close today will come before the inevitable fake and gay eod sell off
do not buy TSLA today  Sell call credits on the rip
Point being, we all know US trust lawsuits on big tech are bullshit.   China on the otherhand... There is a lot of risk still.
Guys you should watch Fox Business and buy puts on any stock they pump. They tried to pump SNE just now
You don't you just keep making worse decisions that's why the first ones always free
I can imagine it. My calls were down 50% and I just didn't want to dump more money in. These half trading days with expected low volume after a red day are easy pump days. Now I know.
I’m never touching BABA again 😬
Trust me, we gucci in a few hours man. I'm up on my 131c but only put 1 option. Waiting for 133c to get a bit closer. I'll let you know when I'm out
I’m going balls to the wall in AMZN calls EOD

#TSLA 🎄   If it breaks above the $659 level, it’s going to try for new ATH today! Wasn’t planning on playing it today but I saw my neighbor installing the new Tesla roof and it inspired me...🚀
Time for BABA calls yet?
pretty much what i'm doing. got 80 shares at $270. so willing to wait and see how low this POS will go before I can start selling CC at least.
Dude relax there is like two algos at Goldman running right now that’s it,
CNBC with that instant boner.🤤
I’m up like 75% since March from just stocks. Haven’t touched any options. Should I feel okay about that?
Damn did everyone buy that baba dip from a week or 2 ago? sheesh
Why is every every day this week when SPY is flat or slightly green, my stonks fucking tank?
Lmao you’re ok bro
I did so definitely gonna drop another 10%
The mods are hitting him up on Grindr if that’s what you mean by luck

just call credit spreads, so i’m probably fine but why rally on a dumbass day like today
Thank chrysler
BFT 🚀
it may go up another 10% before you get a 5% pullback. I waited for a while and finally got in this week for ARKK
It’s not the trend that’s important. The buying is going to be sudden if it happens today.
NVTA under $50 really is a Christmas discount. I bet $100 will be a steal next year

These pacb are so deep itm I'm losing liquidity.

BABA is fuk
100%
Umm that’s it STIC?
The OG investors are saying to wait. I’ll wait till next week. I’ll just sell puts on SQ today and get some free money.
Yo CCP u guys bought enough BABA shares and calls yet? DM me when u are done
Yeah I’d say definitely buy a bit of both stocks and options. Maybe it’ll have a small correction at some point but I think within the first 90 days Biden is going to make tons of announcements that will be huge for clean energy. I have stock in my roth and then Feb, April and July 2021 calls
What stonks and yes
I need RIOT to go up and PLTR to go down a little
just waiting for that daily Tesla crash 20mins before close

Because the open interest is basically zero look at the spread
Why is NIO acting like this

I would say no, it should price similar to Fastly which is $100+ at the moment. NET just getting started.

he's in the Senate, the House rejected the additional measure
i bought the dip from like 2 months ago
Let me ask you this, how do we know its not pumping like everything else did after election/vaccine?
Good buying opportunity on SQ
What the fuck Square   Pump the fuck up 💰🟩💰

Fuck no
Some dude bought $6.25M worth of BABA  Jan 2022 270c leaps
Sell and get back in early next week. It may have a small recovery today but it's not done dropping.
ah i see. but possible to just buy, exercise and sell later for a profit right?
I've learned my lesson
Show me where BABA touched you
Yo what should I get my dad for Christmas? Need legit ideas
I’ll take pennies at this point
REEEEEEE JD REEEEEEEE🤬😡🤬😡🤬
Regret selling TSLA already. Its like that break up that you're not sure if it was a good idea or not.
Bought BABA bull call spreads in March. Let’s see what happens.
Imma need a bit more than 1% after the last couple days tho
Yes.
think i kinda overpaid for those LVGW calls  fkkk
What’s up with NVTA? Can’t find shit on it and I’m trying to enter a position.
OPEN opening up
Fuck that guy who said to buy SQ   Your moms a hoe
Must have hit the eggnog early
Yeah, no it's not
NUKE CHINA
Just hold it long!
Absolutely not. Think of all the tendies you left on the table.
You're up $3 a share if you bought when he posted 🤷
Bears out here not even using logic anymore. Game over, take the L now before it gets bigger.

Wtf is going on with G O E V?

Most of the money made in a bubble is being long
I don't play options with ARK. But i started buying weekly a couple weeks back. ARKK/F/G.
Coffee mug, socks, coffee machine if you bought gme, shirts...
It went
Like an idiot placed a market order for my STIC stock and now I’m down. Hope this rockets soon
Step-NIO what are you doing
Falling wedge on CRSR. Should reverse soon
Hell this almost qualifies as DD!
me too. he's in florida so i can blame fedex.
buy 10 share of GME if you read this
All TSLA bears will be crying when we close at 680 today
Legit worried about y all BABA fans anuses. Is Wacko Jack Ma sending barrels of lube?
I'm not Sherlock Holmes or anything but it seems pltr drops everyday at open....
Tim Apple?
Where is SQ support? Looking for another entry point
yes
Big changes are coming to GME. You might want to find a different non-volatile play but if you like losing money, that’s on you.
Sold TSLA too early :(
Feel like Baba could be the most epic long term dip buy ever but I'm not touching it right now. Will be watching it closely
Merry Christmas my retards. Love you all and stay safe out there! :)
If you don't own the position anymore why do you give a fuck what it looks like now?  Use that mentality. Look for the next play, not the play you wish you made.
Dildo
Ok retard. Go all in on a shitty penny stock like FCEL. Lmfao.
Def doesn’t have 💎✋🏻
Yea i could sense that cos it didnt make much sense. I probably would sound like an imbecile if i were interviewed in Spanish or what.
**TSLA**
Below 50% IV is good for large cap stocks. Its way better than tesla. + chinese regulation is swift and decisive. Everything looks priced in already after this massive drop. Baba is almost at at its 1 years ago level. Good risk reward.
Just now?
That’s like being just an observer at an orgy
My guess is an 11am power boner for GME. If not 11, then 12:30.
Ok...but we selling before close right?
Tesla just acquired BABA
You know our politicians suck when Brexit got approved before Stimmy.
Incel
Yesss sell when it’s down! Lol
[removed]
It’s been all over the place. Buying what’s hot and selling when I think the run is over. Most has come from TSLA, NIO, PLTR, XPEV, and now I’m in on all the ARKs and TAN.
and goev
Go for feb. Biden gonna pump
Alibaba investors not having a good day or month.  But if you invest in China. This is a big real risk.  The government can do whatever it wants. Xi will protect his power. $baba
when are we getting in BABA? 220s?
⚡ Semiconductor ion implantation is neat  ⚡
thank fuck i sold sq at open
Up significantly early, what else is new. Can’t wait to see how I end up getting fucked today
Pahmp eeeeet.
Woo TSLA 🚀 🚀 🚀
Fuck LightShed Partners for dissing FUBO!
Tell me about this company if you would. Nobody talks about it but Cathie owns a shit ton of it. I can’t find news on it when it’s up or down. I’m trying to enter a position.
Totally different governments in the US. Papa Pooh Bear can do whatever the fuk he wants. Our government is an oily sack of farts with big techs giant dong inside it. Daddy ma angered the most powerful dictator in the world and now he's dealing with the consequences.
Why did you guys sell tsla??? Wheres my retards who bought the dip yesterday 🚀 🚀
Holding paper like a g
GME too the 🤑🤑🤑 going back to sleep.
30 mins ago
Stic talk that stic talk
Still spreading around corona.
I don’t think you have to worry, after 2 +20% days and still not dumping I’d say it’ll hold pretty solid. Plus, like someone pointed out, we have a (very) thin chance of shorts covering today.
Is there a good iPhone app for tracking option premiums? Like the yahoo finance of options
GOD DAMN GOEV LMFAO
I just thought people were taking care of that yesterday, starting their holiday last night.
Best darn tough socks. Or whatever that brand brand is called. Heard they’re the fucking best. Or duluth trading co buck naked underwear. I fucking love them.
Ok I can check that one off lol
TSLA saving me, AMD destroying me  Why it gotta be like that
Playing GME daily is fun, make money every 10 mins buy dip at 20.8-20.5 sell at 21+ ...rinse n repeat
You joke, sure. But many retards died to make that joke funny.
Most people would be happy with 10% in a year.
APHA casually throwing off half its gain from yesterday.
Sold most but I should have sold all.
$OPEN on the moooovvveeee
Sell! Baba asap
yeah merry christmas to you too SQ
Really? Fuck. I thought it was just down because of normal trading shenanigans. Hopefully I got it on the dip tho.
I dumped a bunch around 645. It just now made it back there. You can always buy back in. :-)
Guide to diamond hands on GME: don't be a bitch and zoom in only, zooming out are only for pussy boomers from /r/stocks. You see dip you buy, we work towards 50 EOY retards
Yeah I agree with you.
I hope it does, crazy volatile.
228
TSLA 670 EOD
Won’t This drop the price?
I have a gambling addiction
Su Bae what is this piss poor performance ? make AMD fly 🪰
BLNK jumping again today.
GME double bottom, BULLISH
atleast you helf your calls and didnt panic sell
W shaped graph for PLTR, FDs are GUUH
Ah yes, diminishing returns
So is my butthole. Getting prolapsed anus from all the deep fisting by jack ma, ccp, India and sec.
Np.a next moon mission spac?
Bft gonna give us a new bottom every day next week
Sir, this is a casino.  For real tho, who is listening to citron??
 Desending triangle on GME, full on war between bulls and bears rn. If it does break through to the upside, expect ~23 ish target. If it fails to, 18.50-19, and slow bleed downwards
Everything is up ... hard to differentiate. I look at it like this .. the downside is probably into low 40s or high 30s I don’t see it dropping more than that worse case scenario. There are a couple $50 and $60 Price targets from respected funds in the last couple days.  But the upside is definitely there - look at roku. If they can secure some good content deals or get into sports betting as they are planning to, this easily runs to 100. Risk Reward play. Perhaps play it safe with shares or longer dated options.
Holding shares at an average of $18. I feel good about the future.
💩
Moving all my money into spac
Holy shit
May they still have Christmas tendies one day
PLTR going above 30, get in olnow or regret
Anyone going to Time Square for NYE celebrations?
To feel better about the AMZN dip I chart it next to BABA.
I kicked that shit to the curb.
that just means we’ll continue to rally on stimulus hopes for another couple months

Friday is low volume I think Monday people will buy the dip pretty fast. I grabbed a starter position for FEB 255c and JAN 2022 $300c LEAP
MMs want GOEV absolutely dead lmfao
I hope so, I just got some 0-days for that strike :)
Guys I can’t tell who’s trying to help Amman’s who’s actually retarded. Am I retarded???
Literally buy calls we're closing green today it's Christmas Eve
wow i had great fun riding tsla to 650+, and then thought it should drop down since s&amp;p was the only news that brought it up 70%. guess my dumbass was wrong :/
G H I V  mad strenght
I love AMD as much as the next guy and made a lot of money off it in the past. That said I really do think it’s going to be flat for quite a while, like months. 2 of the worlds largest companies have both said they basically will be making their own chips moving forward, and they absolutely have the money/resources the buy the talent necessary to do so.  That’s a lot of potential lost revenue for INTC and AMD. I think theta gang wins on AMD for a while.
Lots of selling. I thought maybe it had short-term support at 230 but nah.
You should feel great about that, but you’d be up 750% if you bought options.
A good flashlight. Surefire or Streamlight. Don't know you need a good light until you have one.
All I hear is blah blah I am a bitch blah blah
One can dream! 🚀 🌕
Qqqj calls keep bleeding
I thought they agreed but Trump wanted to give us all more tendies
Thanks APPLE 🍻 done for the long weekend! Closing out green

I am seeing the BABA entry point soon.. fucking risky tho
FCEL has been an interesting ride. DOE interest should make it fun for a bit.
Wish I timed it better but this is fine 🚀
You guys are such pussies, if you sold on most stocks you’re going to be crying after Xmas. Just hold and watch shit go higher not hard, stomach the red days the dip gets bought up
Honestly the market is just algos fucking with retards that know will buy high and sell low. And that includes me
This is going nowhere. There is no santa rally. All of it was bullshit
Anybody have any good autistic share buys? FSR and GRWG looking like top candidates.
Stop loss at $28 on pltr. 5 min chart shows a nice little bullish reversal. If it fails there, I’ll wait another day to hop in
Yaaa my calls not doing so hot
The best Dip for 2020 is BABA. don't miss it
has to break 29.2
ew. my condolences
If you bought and held leaps from March you'd be up 7500% from March.
IM NOT SELLING
I would love to see the Grand Canyon some day. My biggest returns have been NIO, TSLA, SPCE, XPEV, and PLTR. Just been lucky enough to buy when they’re hot and sell before the drop. I’m in on ARK (all 5) and TAN now and just gonna let things coast up.
BLNK and you'll miss it! Paper handed myself out if like 40k by selling calls at 300% instead of the 3000% they're at now 🤡
Because of the -4% yesterday? Where do you value them?
Tatoo chef great long play
Anyone else getting killed today?
Buy the dip
how sure of that are u
Elon wants to do a deal with AAPL. Mark it.  TSLA and AAPL going to Mars. Literally.
Kinda weird to get my dad underwear lol
I'm 50% on the year and feel good man, you should be proud, you outperformed a fuckton of people and hedge funds. S&amp;P is up I believe like 15% this year, so yeah, you did good.
Need a yolo
It’s an abusive relationship. Not sure how long longer I can take it.
Definitely. Although learning options could be monumental. I’ve done the exact opposite, no shares only options, and am up about 450% since March.
Elon, give me another push. Just get it to 670
Remember last year when Mango tweeted out on 26th that it was the best e-shopping holiday of all time?  My PTON, AMZN, and SHOP calls hope for a repeat.

It looks like market doesn't care about Brexit deal done
Butt Plug
My Baba shares are down 25%. Should I sell or sell other shares to buy this dip
I’ll load up if it reaches 215
I like it, thank you!
I got 300c for June
He don’t drink coffee and just threw out half his sock drawer and bought all new socks.
All them people but no bathrooms !
i hate buying puts but i'd rather be throwing knives than catching them and baba is free money atm
You guys ever talk to your stocks?
Hmmm....how bout that NKLA dip?? Thinking about bagholding for an autistic pump loll
The big three state corporates that betrayed China and transfered their ownership to a shell capital overseas. Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent.
The real tendies are the friends we’ve made along the way ❤️😘
I also have ARKK

Buy SQ calls today?
Yep, but I don’t got those diamond hands 💎
Go my lotto scratcher winners early. Thank you meme lords, sir Tim and sir Elon.    Merry Christmas Eve, gamblers anonymous.

Tim AAPL flying once again 🔥
buy 10 GME shares if you read this
My father said the same thing before $T fell off a cliff like 20 years ago after the government skewered it
well pltr was green for like 2 seconds
I’m mad I didn’t buy FL  I fuckin liked that company when Cramer talked about it like a week ago too
Bought the dip on baba but it’s still dipping
merci bohcoo
Dude, how??
I’ve bought too much BABA. AMA.
$TSLA about to rip higher :)
QS about to take of 🚀
For the long hold, it is easy money.
anyone else feeling a huge selloff about 5-10mins before close?
BLNK turning the thrusters into overdrive
We close at 370
Can you update me when/if I should buy please. I want to be cautious with my last play today. No day trades left. $435 in account remaining to use right now
BABA a falling knive. Puts are free money imo.
Loading up
oops
Dems are having a field day with the GOP infighting lmao. Trump burnt him and the GOP with him
Get him a air fryer or something
Who the fuck buys stocks?
Nope, MM not going to let ptlr hit $30 today. I'd be surprised if it holds $28. Definitely hitting 30 next week though.
I think PDD too. I bought a few Jan 170c yesterday on a alert for 200. Their like quadruple today😂
Same. I thought the MSFT news was seriously bad for chip makers. Not immediate effects, but it shows a trend
That was yesterday news.... today GOP blocked the $2000 stimmy bill
Freinds?
Wth
Sell your BABA shares then rebuy them since a lower average looks cool and you get tax breaks for securing losses
[deleted]
Sq goes up every single day until I buy it lol ok
Just rage bought AMZN as a revenge move on BABA
Yeah i yell at them to go up, but they ignore me
Fuck you thanks
BABA at the bottom finally
It will go down big before Jan 15 lol  Someone's gonna go after it again
Stld only goes down. Fuck my calls apparently
Oh fuck BABA has left the chat and banned himself lmfao
Waiting for the Trump Merry Christmas ya Filthy Animal tweet to rug pull this fake market
Okay Buddy you can do it
Get out of BABA now, shit has been bad since last week when they found out that its app is spying on people
💎💎 &gt;!GME ICLN BB TLRY!&lt;  💎💎
Correct
You'll prob regret paper hands rn
Yea i said caonima to BABA
so buy calls?
So I shouldn’t have jumped in to cleanenergy at $8.50, guess I didn’t buy the dip.
GME 🚀🚀🚀🚀
Trump doesn't need to sign the relief bill. He could absolutely avoid getting his veto overridden by not even signing it at all, and letting the government shutdown by Monday.
Fuck Amzn and NIO today
The idea of PLTR suddenly ripping seems like a fantasy
No thanks!
Yup great time to buy
Baba loves to bleed. We'll see, I think it could head for 200 over the next week
They’re called europoors for a reason
Im holding the same SPACs, any thoughts on an exit price?
I would, but can't trade options on them :(
TSLA 670 by 1200 🚀🚀🚀🚀
This is why I never use TA for selling my TSLA covered calls.  TSLA defies logic. I stick to Dr Patel’s advice.  Always set TSLA weekly strike at $200 above current share price. Used this method weekly since May. Guaranteed tendies and shares never get called away.
my sq and aapl calls have canceled each other out
not worth it with this IV
Literally my life rn

It's close to YEAR low...
Give me a 0dte
QS  🌚🚀???
holy crap gme has the potential to hit $25 today
This week has just been GUH after GUH after GUH. Santa rally my ass
Sorry I sold you my calls
Baba 220p. Made $50 big bucks.
I just want to see Apple back at ATH by end of year.
100
10 contracts AAPL 130c 1/29 bought in early December. Stay tuned fellas
Dips on thcb
I'm gonna bet we invested in different stocks.
PDD puts, will dip back down after the baba hype cools down
I’ve been shilling this shit for days. Hope somebody listened. I think it’ll hit $60 next week.
I sold a bunch of 670 calls that I'm regretting right now. This feels like last week when it hit 690
The CCP really hate Christmas huh.
That’s what you get for holding shitty Chinese stocks. All in America 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
IPOC!!!!
Lmao SQ is fuckeddddd

This is the way
[removed]
but papa only abusive us cause he loves us.
SPACers taking profits.  Give it a month.
Is Ghi.v rkt 2.0?
What’s up with SQ
I agree, but leap calls are big $$$
Its pretty crazy how 9-12 month out calls still swing 5-10% any given day even with the slightest of movement on stock.
Baba wat u doin bb
I had 5500 shares in July or so around $6. I sold them under $10 to “diversify” 🤡🤡🔫
Who’s holding MGNI 1/15 calls? What’s your strategy? I’ve been holding some 22c for about a month now and they are up bigly. Wonder how much this run has left in it...
The real reason not to sell: taxes. Push cap gains to 2021 with not having to worry about paying until 2022.
TSLA legit closing all time high
They blocked the increase from 600 to 2000  As they should, we've printed enough fucking money
Hold these aapl 132c that expire 1/8 or sell?
Honestly it's up to you. Personally I'd wait for it to bounce back and then sell but that might not happen
[removed]
Sad
China will never take over if they dont let their companies fuck them in their ass.
Why
Lol @ bark box post getting removed. Seemed like decent DD at first, that guy pulled off a 20% gain on like 1.5 mil in a day, you best believe he dumping at any given moment.
190-205 range
Baba
Yeah never gonna be able to time it perfectly. I bought at 226.  Basically if its just gonna be a slap on the wrist, it will moon back up to 300+  If not, then well you lose money regardless of what point you bought in today.
Why is SQ fucking me
190-205
gamestop short squeeze pls
Best of luck homie. Rooting for ya
Yeah I’m losing hope
Jesus Christ CRSR ahahahha I’ve got stocks but at least do something
Called the TSLA rip lol
Jack Ma fucked around and caught some old school China shit.... get out if you can, they are the tank... he is the student.... this ends poorly
Algos just fuking us 12/24 47c holders
So what do I do with LULU
What’s your expected reaction?  Stimulus deal for USA is in shambles right now so if you were expecting ripping green then I imagine it would be muted by political wrangling but I could be wrong.
Nope. I bought 1k shares. Thinking of selling calls, but don’t think I want to hold these shares that long. Wish I could sell weeklies. Jan 15 is earliest expiry. What did you sell?
Stimmy going limp
Oh you said paper lol, I thought you meant 💎
Bought JD dip instead of baba
So what you guys think if a Gov shutdown happens... impact on SPY? Deep dive??   Took a small hedge on spy 305p jan 21!   Btw for the retards out there I don’t expect spy to hit 305 just more intrinsic value to far OTM versus close ITM in such low IV
Im on the train and people next to me are talking about how much money they made in the stock market. The top is in
son: daddy y no christmas presents this year  ? 😥  father: i'm sorry son santa died   \*(in reality he was holding baba calls)\*
Just hang on
Rookie numbers. Apha sometimes throws off all gainz. Perfect wsb stock.
I am pounding the table to buy baba
Someone tell me if a Chinese company talks shit about their government so I can buy puts on that company
This BLNK ride is unreal.  I just wish i had more than 1 contract.
What did you say about BB?
What did Jack Ma do wrong? Was he competing against the chinese banks with his company? In any case, it would be hard to break up ALibaba or hurt Jack Ma in any way cause that would piss off a lot of other people that are bringing money in China. I'd buy this dip
The volume on BABA. Damn.
[removed]
I hate fidelity. On a fast moving stock they always fill you at ATH
My 0dte would appreciate this
#IPOC pump it CHAMATH
Maybe those v bounces were the rallies
It’s not going to go down, but I will say it’s unlikely to do anything today. Once volume picks back up on Monday there should be fireworks it’s just a matter of what kind
Brexit deal went through. RYCEY to 100 EOY
I was so convinced baba leaps were the play yesterday
All that santa rally spamming for 2 weeks. U guys shouldnt breed
Went from 35 to 230 in a few months.
Load up on SQ chaps🌝
Looks like selling BABA calls at open was the right play. Second guessed myself but glad to be rid of it now.
BABA isn’t shitty
At least I’ve secured 2 years of write offs this year :) fuck my life and fuck 2020 man how did I not make money this year
VLDR just ruined Xmas
Talk to them
I think you’re late.  Go read the recent news
TSLA you s3xy slut!
Dyslexia is tough though.  He probably meant QS
Day ain’t over. This shit box finishes sub 650
[removed]
Too late to buy into this today?
tesla doing the thing again!
Because a lot of motherfuckers are buying them thinking BABA will bounce at least a little bit.
Haha I minimized my risk over the weekend by selling friday, planned to buy the dip but paper handed real quick by buying in same price monday evening. Ah well, it's not like I'm q day trader anyways
Yes, but hedge funds and shorts out for blood after the loss they incurred from  shorting at 50 and shorting at 70. Homeless speed runners.
Yes. You have put in no work whatsoever and you've had solid gains
Still 4 trading days left of the year
Yea it might be the time to enter soon. I bet CCP did this so that they can buy some shares. Baba is too big to kill cuz it’s a money maker for them .
I loaded up on shares at 214 in April. Then reloaded with 400c LEAPs when it dipped from 319 to 290. That's sitting at -80% right now...
I don't think I'd buy BABA until it hits like 150 or lower. You guys realize China isn't the US, right? They will just fucking destroy the company if they want to. Insanely risky.
Qqqj what the fuck bro why so flaccid
Weekly?
Is stock market open today?
Thankfully sold my calls when stock was Around $20. Looking to enter sub $18
Those meme stocks were crazy this year. Glad you could make a profit on them.
Good time to stock up on FCEL?
Good ole Melon sneaking up his price while everyone looking at China.....
AAPL 133 gang
Like oh shit pull out?
True but risky as hell
Just think of it as investing and on ya way
buy leaps on RKT now
Robinhood starting to slip up
yep i bought those lol
Anyone else having the worst fucking week of their lives? Maybe it’s cuz I’m Jewish and this week is Christmas but Jesus Christ this is the fucking horse shit!
Imagine not buying fubo right now
Gme
However also should have bought the 220p 0dte I wanted to as well but figured why turn a losing play into a play at risk of losing more.
Lost almost 6K in 2 days after an over 25K run in 3 months.  Merry Christmas Congress
That’s my golden rule. Don’t buy puts. You can hedge with vixy calls
i haven't held a put overnight since march so you do you, but i am not touching this until it is under 200
Here's your entry point. 227
We just riding the brexit trade deal rn, this is going to fade at this volume
Yeah then you pay under that very cool joe Biden tax plan
Can Papa take us to the 700 promise land today
What if big stonk is mooning because Chinese competition just took a small slap with chinas gov quick scoping baba
Same
I hope the GOP lost senate seats in Georgia   Clowns 🤡
Why is no one talking about BLNK jesus
I bought , fuck it
SQ kick it in reverse for thirst please.
So I should have really bought BABA puts at open 😭   Congratulations to those who did 👏
I rolled over in to March calls earlier this week.
Wtf no $2000 stimulus check??? F u republican cunts
Ok I was worried with iv. Seemed a bit high
Most in here do. You'll.sell.your left but for 10 grand if you could
Thank god my baba calls are leaps Jesus
I was debating on being dip yesterday but held off
Real expensive to buy a 75c but I believe it’ll keep going up
I hope MT prints next few months.
This is wallstreetbets not wallstreet low risk bonds
Trying to give us s3xy Xmas presents early
Feel free to just use the term “calls”
They were free money but after it’s already down 30% from October? Doubt it
PLTR swinging like a pregnant bitch
Could TSLA go 5% today?
Gyna is asshoe
GME
Ohhh PDD is BABA competition, that’s why they’re rallying so hard
BABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABAB
Rookie numbers...
$OPEN &amp; $SQ  on sale for Christmas Eve is a present sent by Santa 😍
Don’t need to imagine. I’m not buying
nah
Maybe AAPL will buy VLDR
You clearly don’t know SQ
Hold till next week
What the fuck is this pos trying to do
Alibaba is the biggest piece of shit stock ever
Buy the dip
The great BABA war has begun.
Don't take my word on it tho nobody knows how the stock is going to move
It’s hitting all time high before close
Buy and Hold GME 💎 💎💎💎
Sold GME 0dte for 33% gain. Jumped into some Tesla 0dte 670c. Butthole is puckered
PLTR swinging like a pregnant bitch
I am never buying SLV calls again.  Tired of riding that motherfucker.
More likely to be MVIS
they bought tidal
I didnt have previous position, I bought in at 226. I'm betting itll be slap on the wrist. Hard to call it to be honest.
I don't have the numbers other than what RH is telling me, but MCFE $25 2/19 also up big today. Someone betting on cybersecurity market
Papa Elon, will we see 700 today?
I’m poor to begin with so there’s that
How long have you been a member of the communist party!
This dip is just getting started
11%
GOEV about to rip
If i had some cash id invest in baba but gme ate it all
BABA really ded
Invitae actually has a very simple business: they extract your DNA and tell you what your gene sequences are. This is going to be a necessary first step in just about every new medical breakthrough so they will sell a lot of kits. On top of that the knowledge you gain by analyzing a database of these gene sequences will be immensely valuable.
While I don't know for sure, I am fairly certain they won't destroy companies when they already have some financial market issues under the surface
Spoke too soon.
Buying the dip on xl was a mistake
hmmm not a bad move bossman.
ALIBABA KEEPS SINKING WTF
Source?
Who’s still in STIC ?
GME won't stay above the VWAP.  I'm out have a merry Christmas.
guh
I started playing with it in July/August... Had maybe 2k between 7.5 and 17.5 calls expiring Jan. Seeing meteoric rise last 2 weeks or so was waiting for a dip that has yet to come to rebuy in.
Do we think IPOC will crank to $20 by Feb??
BABA$ DUDE HOLY FUCK!!!!
Puts on GME. I ordered two games and those motherfuckers sent a completely different game and forgot to put the other game in the box. Truly retarded
Held it since it was $9 bucks to $70 bucks lol. I love $SQ but sometimes it needs a breather!
Good bot
Opened +600, now -100...fun :D
LGVW and THC B man what are you guys doing?
Dude. Fuck jack ma. Little squinty eyed fucking mushroom
It's a bit harsh... $8 maybe $20-28... lol

Time to load up on Baba. Nice dip for us
O A C
All the NIO winners are dumping into TSLA to avoid a BABA
Patiently waiting for the BABABottom
Nice.
always
The one day I invest in gme is the day it doesn’t moon, can’t complain too much
Yep.. guh
It's going sub 200...
Because it’s step brother FCEL has more room to grow. (Also cuz I’m pissed I sold my calls at 137 on Monday
Nio holy shit bro
Open is up over 4%, how is that on sale?
Unless these COTY calls print I’m taking off for a couple months to build up some more capital to lose in a week, getting nowhere off the small sums I’m feeding the market rn
fucking jack couldnt keep his dumb mouth shut
BABA free falling
the sus part for me was only responding to 2 comments, both times saying like "wow this shit post is having an impact? haha"
Man, that poor BABA 1/15/2021 yolo guy. All his other YOLOs were really good. This one was too, based on the Nov info. F
EBay you PoS
Ill look into it thanks
I expected the market to not be flat at least with the deal is done. The marker is flat the whole day
This was fully expected.  &amp;#x200B;  Unknown yet if mango man will veto it, which means delays in getting the current one out plus potential gov. shutdown.  Merry fucking xmas, gov't employees.
You seeing something I'm not? Not exactly blasting  off    Yet...
Real shit volume today
BUY THE SQ$ DIP
#China is ass

Cmon Elon I want to sell the top go back to 660

Ik too poor for multiple things do I take a profit on my gme 23c 4/16 got it for 212 worth 548 kinda want to buy some shares in gme and aphria
I checked the open interest, it's dogshit. No idea why this is an "unusual" trade.   It's 6 weeks out barely out of the money.
RYCEY GOING PARABOLIC RN
Yeah, went from -50% for 0/15 90c up to -18%. Need a decent day next week.

RIP BABA
RIP GOEV ppl. if this thing doesnt pop now i dont see how it'll pop later when more shares becomes available to dump
tencent was innocent. why they get the xi bone too
At a loss? NAHHH bought them yesterday
Yeah I want some exposure to it
"stimmy talks going well" pump is back on the menu

somebody is buying baba right now, keep that in mind
if i never made any bad trades I'd be so rich
I'll sell my what
Boring day. No MMs to steal our money.
1000%   But that’ll happen by Jan 6. That’s their merger date. And then it’ll dip to $18 two days after and then rip
They both are baby
HO HO HO everybody! I blew up my account.

That’s racist homie
Its my birthday today. I went all in on XL stock this morning at $34.50 and just sold at 30.50 I lost 10% of my portfolio. Not a good way to start the day.
Ok I didn’t learn the hard way  made 200$ but also sadly missed out on 500$ profit. Don’t buy weekly ITM options for AAPL that expire in 3 days 😅
Stfu retard

This...may not be the place for you.
Wish QS would just pick a direction
It's only down 1%...
It will young grasshopper it will
Good time to buy BABA?
BABA going to 0?
lmfao
You right that’s too far. Let’s get back to making autism jokes
Wait 20m
I need my AMZN calls next week to save my BABA calls to break even. Dangit!
Dad's are simple. Go sentimental. Do a trip or guided fishing if he's into that. Do a framed picture of you and him. Doesnt have to be expensive or elaborate.
Simply...having...a wonderful Tesla time
If I actually shorted stock I would ride NKLA all the way to $0
I'm an old school Assassins Creed fan, been playing since day one. I really haven't enjoyed the recent games, starting with Syndicate, but especially Origins and Odyssey. I'm a completionist, so I still force myself to 100% them, but I'm not happy about it. It's a sickness.  What do ya'll think of the new one? It's on sale this week and Daddy needs to treat himself to something. Calls on Valhalla?
Rycey 👀
TSLA
Imagine not buying calls on Chinese small caps right now. They mooning because BABA being broken up
Ain't done dipping
WTF Baba 😒
Ya wtf...
Is CRSR doing the same garbage it did earlier this week where it goes down to $36 and them skyrockets to the $40s? I just gotta remember that its next earnings date is Feb 8th.
thank you for your service
So SPY gonna give us a nice Christmas or pull the rug in the last 5 minutes like yesterday?
So much fear about Chinese stocks, tencent down 5%. Great time to go all in
BABA literally has no buyers - it's terrifying to watch
Damn Baba almost completely wiped out gains from the entire year
You could have literally bought just about any put on BABA yesterday and made a 50-100x bagger   And here I am... holding PLTR
Imagine buying 220p BABA yesterday for a penny.
Look at look the LMND's chart and volume before the middle of November and early. Now look at the chart $EVER and realize its fully recovered from their CEO kicking the bucket.
killed by baba
John and Pete najarian fuck pussy don’t they
I imaging this is what being raped feels like...
by who? Lmfao
[removed]
Honestly, I think you'd make more doing that with PLTR. It's so much more predictable. Morning 5 min moons, then sell off in next 15, followed by day of slow recovery. Rinse n repeat every day.
lol https://i.imgur.com/GjOpq5o.jpg
Everything is dead over here in NVDA land. Volume is abysmal still I guess another month before a breakout toward PT
How is SPY still mooning? Literally every stonk on my watchlist (boomer, tech, and meme) are dropping like yesterday's close
technically not a leap if it's less than a year out, but very nice work. you get the 1/22 exp or earlier?
#LETS GOO IPOC
Hey man, I’m so sorry to hear that. But happy birthday! I hope this is the lowest point for the year ahead of you. You’ll get it back. Don’t worry bro. Have a great rest of your day
It's ccp fault not Jack ma
holy shit BABA is going down even more
Yes can’t express this enough. People will say “why was no one talking about FCEL.. no we did you people just don’t listen
When to buy the BABA dip?
SQ on sale

This is why you don’t put money into a Chinese company.  Learned my lesson after LK when it dropped 90% in one day for fraud 🤣🤣
All baba bag holders moving to mr musk TSLA baby
i put 90% of my account in baba shares
Yesterday someone said you’ll never see FUBO below 55 again. It’s down $10 since. Oof.
Will PLTR break out now?
GME wedge down forming. Get out of those calls
We’re closing above market close from last Friday (695)
Jack Ma was forced into retirement by Xi because he was taking up the spotlight and taking away power from CCP. But to prevent a power struggle, they let him stay as Board Director. They thought installing an army puppet with strong ties to CCP would eventually help them finally fully control Alibaba. Instead, CEO changed sides and worked with Ma to make a shell capital overseas and shift all the ownership there. Ma then comes out of "retirement" and hype a super power fintech IPO called Ant Group, that is a big fuck you to Xi especially when it consists of CEOs from different state companies that are market leaders. So now there is a power struggle, because if Xi loses then Capitalism will take hold fully.
Real talk, real estate in CA/Bay Area or stonks?
Can someone explain to me why GameStop or GME is rocketing?
Something I'm not aware of for RYCEY?
God damn PLTR stop blue balling me, please give me one more 🚀 day so I can get out! I promise I’ll be better next year

What did jack do to piss the party off ?
Jacky Ma just in reduction camp. When he finishes, china will let BABA fly again. BULLISH
Gg my friend
just bought the XL dip. Profit takers expected after a huge runup, stocks dont go straight up. it will take me to Valhalla or ill ROPE.
How you doing?

Baba 215p... 80000%... If only..
It has a ton of short volume, I got in on Monday hoping it’d ride the EV wave and potentially squeeze like QS. Went in a few months ago but sold for a small profit, wish I’d just held my long-dated calls but happy with its current run.
Sooo what's the meme stock to close out this year?

BABA sold off -8% in HK, now -14.4% and counting in US. Sure Commies are scary and shit but the discrepancy stands out. Does HK know something that we don’t?
so wont JD be the winner here? why they selling off?
I mean that tidal deal doesn't make much sense for a fintech company

Now let's see if the GOP can override orange fat asses veto on covid relief. Trump is a good entertainer
Had 2 TSLA 645c 12/31. Sold one 650c 12/31 to lock in half and did some research on call debit spreads... makes sense now!
People are paper handing BABA. Think it will be a slap on the wrist. I think I will buy some calls
Sucks RH will close out options one hour before close.

Sorry to whoever was in baba. Holy fuck.
Can confirm bought near top in August.
The picture is a good idea. The guide trip is a little out of my price range rn and we just went in October.
Ditched BABA and now I’m bored and need new positions
Wait a bit. Catch it on the upswing. You’ve got time
Yes Nick, don’t put all of your $86 into BABA.
NO FUCKING 🧢
Classic pump and dump, ready for profit taking?
who’s going cash over the weekend
thanks a lot mate, do you have some resource for me to dig deeper into this, like good write up or an article?
end of year profit taking?  Or people finally realizing they spend more on electricity than they gain in coins?
Fuck half days for real
Keep cash on hand for a potential drop.
Is NIO a part of BABA all of a sudden cause all my NIO gains are gone
EOD pump in T minus 1 hour, buy the dip baguettes
IT WILL TRUSS IN CHAMATH
What goes up, must come down.  It will always come back down
Yeah -3% since I wrote that..I’ll watch you from the side😊
Bought the BABA dip with some debit spreads. Low volume day is probably making the sell-off worse.
fcel at a dip rn?
Your dad should have taken it out
What happened
Yea I couldn't afford it even after the split
This is the reddest Green Day
[removed]
And another fack pump, we go lower....
Baba?
No short interest or volume whatsoever . I really believe TSLA closes all time high
I don't think it will find support until $200, so I'd maybe buy under $205
No just hold it for a few years
did BABA puts actually gained that much
Next time PLTR breaks $30 it’s not coming back down to earth
What are they buying

PLTR making me sad.

Zero day trades left for this guy so I’m forced to hold.
&gt; So let’s recap where we are on Christmas Eve. &gt;  &gt; Unemployment expires Saturday. &gt;  &gt; Government funding expires Monday. &gt;  &gt; House Rs blocked Dem 2k check bill.  &gt;  &gt; Senate R leadership says 2k check bill cant get 60 in the Senate, unlikely to bring it up.  &gt;  &gt; No plan to keep govt open.  https://twitter.com/JakeSherman/status/1342129703692496898

Baba will close around 200. Still some dumps to do before closing due to uncertainty IMO.   200-205 will be a good buy. Don't buy yet!
At what point do we get leaps on BABA, cause nothing ever comes from these probes on the big companies.
I got out break even by the skin of my teeth whew.
Same position. So far I’ve been fucked. Might jump off that canoo and into the lake
How’s that going for ya?😂

Hmmm maybe just the autistic share buy I need. This, FSR, or GRWG....

Have you looked at the volume on BABA? Already three times the average daily volume.
Crazy considering 200 million shares entering the market soon.  Expect employee dump fest

2021 will be different! (Maybe)
Yes. They were 0$ a day ago

Which one?
Are we tired of winning yet?
They unblocked this?
I’m buying the XL dip. I’m being greedy.

Thoughts on FEYE? FOMOed in at the top. CC my way out today? or just hold?
Both.  My calls are 6/18 for VSAT and 7/16 for SATS.
Thank you.
Works well for my debit spreads - thanks!
Oof my JMIA calls  Friendship ended with Jumia, Now Recaf is my best friend
We got so spoiled the other day
I own 30 of them.
GME goin dooooooowwwwnnn
Boomers rejoice.  SPY &gt; ARK.  MSFT/AAPL/AMZN/MSFT &gt; TSLA/ROKU/CRSP/SQ
my bags are heavy and dusty
Hang in there bro. Always a new day tomorrow. You can talk to us here
Isn't the volume today bigger than the daily average?
TSLA i love u
Yup lol
Holding july here
I just got a D Notice from the government for buying Chinese stocks. WTF
Is this the BABABOTTOM
Bought it myself 💎✋🏻
SPCE go **BOOM bOoM**
Baby NET, baby Apple 🥰
Just going to accept today is going to be a -1% today and get on with it. Nothing to be done.
Nope
True story
Sold half of work horse calls at open would have made like 4k
Thank you.
Trump leaving govt shut down til Jan 20th there's no solution to this tantrum.
Let's goooo TSLA 🚀🚀🚀
it was you who messed me up
At work until Noon. Only 90 more minutes of being stuck at this godforsaken hell hole
ARE MY TSLA 700 12/24 CALLS GOING TO PRINT???
Profit is profit
Falling wedge on gme?
Anyone gonna go in on BABA? Im at some family event someone tldr the investigation going on into them please, is it serious and could they be delisted or broken up?
Pls post
Is this the floor.. Baba..
I see it as a positive.    It might take some time to push through 21 but at least it isn't dumping. Might establish a new floor here.
Let’s go JD and SE
XL. Just got in.  Gonna go go go.
Still sitting at support at 227. I think this is a good entry for a daytrade I just don’t have any left 😫
Damn I got a debit spread 230/235 exp 12/31 how’s it looking?
You must have BLiNKed once or twice
Someone knows somethingu dont
I think its a little different because its not the us govt but the Chinese govt
Gores Holdings halted due Volatility Trading Pause
Pfe and bntx could litterally fucking cute death and still be flat as a board😒
What a shit day smh
Did I say hahaha. No
all this BaBa talk makes me want some soup dumplings
#All the ARK funds are drilling
China is different from the US. Are you so sure about this?
I love it, let it refuel a bit
It’s ok bro...you bought sq at the wrong time...don’t cry
We buying this BABA dip? Or is it a multi-day sort of thing...
Or lost 4K
Lots of meme stocks drilling today, corsair drilling my portfolio
Brexit.
I’m diamond handing these 12/31 135 calls in to the ground. Sucks
Actually Baba backs XPEV... Which was briefly green but still down less than NIO
I refresh the page and it goes up or down
Fucking 16% drop on XL from open - gg to any put buyers
[deleted]
Fuck PLTR
CANT CUCK MUSK
Some tickers i havent heard of, the only one i recognized was NIO
Nahhh GME pops $1 in like 5 mins
-6% on NET is the best gift ever, its my fifth time i‘ve averaged up
I’m looking for the next one too, PLTR or LAZR could be solid leaps this year, premium kinda high now. GE $10 calls picked up in March for 1/15/21 did very well. They were pretty much dead until early November 😂
Are you retarded? This is wallstreetbets.
FSR and PLUG trying to make something happen here
I feel you bro, boomer stocks aren’t sexy, but they are consistent
You mean roughly when GameStop releases holiday sales and shows they’ve sold literally every single console they own? Okay I bet it’s gonna plummet
Safest bet is when it breaks the trendline from yesterday to the opening this morning. You'd end up buying much higher but you'll also avoid getting in too early.
They made that guy who made the post $300k overnight
I stand corrected - I guess I was thinking of the market in general, not BABA specifically
Who knows....only thing I care is that its going up. And if they did, then everyone will catch on soon
any NYSE tickers you can provide?
unless it just double bottomed, for the day at least
Christmas Eve baby lets go lose some fuckin moneyyyyyy
How clueless are you
How on earth is Zoom at 100B marketcap lmao
buy up the fubo dip
bought the baba dip. Politics aside, baba is doing a sound and healthy business.
Literally my favorite stock. Every time it drops like it did yesterday you just buy calls. It’s free money.
The most sideways stock I’ve had since I bought at $29
RIOT and SQ just cancelled my Christmas.  All gifts going back.
Held after +30, held after -9, holding after +80...... diamond hands brother there is still more upside
[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-24/square-is-said-to-have-discussed-acquiring-jay-z-s-tidal-service](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-24/square-is-said-to-have-discussed-acquiring-jay-z-s-tidal-service)
Where were you when baba died?
Im antisocial
Riot with a casual 10% swing, too bad it's in the wrong direction
Maybe stupid but averaging down on XL
CLIMB TSLA CLIMB
Why do you stay in the relationship, if it is chronically abusive?
cause acquiring tidal is a stupid idea.
what’s the next day trade move
It's just cause Square is down.
This might be baba's biggest drop ever...bought shares and calls
That's what everyone thought the last few times it tanked. "285 buy up that dip", "270 no way that's a steal", "it hit 250 it can't go lower than this", and then this morning "I need to hurry up and get this for $235 premarket before it gaps back up"
[removed]
Calls on macaroni noodle crafts
BLK
Yep. Im long srac as well, commons and warrants.  N p a as well.
Can you even call it dips anymore with BABA or are we just straight-lining to zero.
Not my position, just witnessing in absolute awe
rooting for you! hope a miracle happens
I sold 75% at 19 this morning, leaving my last 500 shares to the pump and dump gods
It’s a Tesla christmas miracle!
Uh yeah, the underlying is down almost 15 percent. If you short exp bought otm puts within the last couple days they would be yuge
Yes BLNK
AAPL $140+ EOW.
💎👏 STANDING BACK AND STANDING BUY
I actually really enjoy losing money so the jokes on you guys
Damn this stock. It just won’t fly. Every launch has been scrubbed.
ARKG, ARKF bringing me pain today. Hold?
Was up 125% on my lotto SPY puts at close yesterday but had no day trades 😔
RKT hit 19 please so I can get in
Fubo and ai
What month for baba long calls?
Bra what is up with JD lmfao
maybe in America, I have no idea how they do things in China when it comes to this shit.
Fucking red across the board for me, not a good day
[removed]
FEYE is a steal at 22
This is the way.  Just hold!
Can spy just have a normal correction? I mean wtf is this shit. The rich have got to be just trading to themselves at this point.
No
Is CRSR dead?
Can't wait to tell the grandkids I was a part of the great GME squeeze of December 2020.
i got a 675 call in tesla, y’all think it’s happening????
Anyone else hop’n on this D N K train?
Stay strong brother
Tf is up with UBER
Thinking of buying a few BABA shares or is it too risky?
I dumped, she's goin back to 20
TSLA
Everything up except for my ARKs 🤡🤡🤡
Alright Elon you’ve pulled me back just like you always do. I never lost faith.
TSLAAAAAAAA
Lost 80% of my money in GME lmao.... really hope this squeeze happens
Holy fuck no one talking about it but apple is kind of back to normal
Sorry kids Jack Ma didn’t want us to have a Merry Christmas this year there are no presents.

Waiting for sector rotation into NVDA   Coiled and ready to pop
What u talkin bout willis
Free speech is cover everywhere you stupid fuck
Yes hold
My hands are literally made from 💎   Either joining rich gang or rope gang
I went on a mad debit spread spree. I'll find out Monday if I'm in a lambo or homeless
Christmas is red and green, therefore we will have some stocks red and some green.  Enjoy your day
Thank Santa I got PRPL to cushion the BABA pain today
uppies pls
i’ve got a 675 and 700 call in it expiration today
That’s because the fat is in the federal budget, not the Covid bill. If they start renegotiating the budget a government shutdown will occur.   Keep in mind that most of the “fat” Trump complained about was in the White House’s budget proposal.
Shouldve dumped money into stic AH yesterday, is it still a good buy yall?
PLTR is coiling up below resistance. It’ll pop any day now.
and baba
&gt;gme  i thought TA was a myth. smh idk whats real anymore
Long mate. Real long. Write puts, buy stonks on margin.
At 660, do you have the midas touch?? Any other stocks that you think are going to fail today? Thoughts on BABA??
in or out?
[removed]
This is really not a good phrase for middle eastern people
if tesla did this yesterday i’d be rich
Anyone got into Tattoed Chef? They seem really undervalued compared to BYND imo
💎👏 AAPL $134 12/24 CALLS STANDING BACK AND STANDING BY
Today so far has gone 📉📈📉 we need to go back up!
Does skyworks have a 2 dollar swing in it? I bought 150C 12/31 at open.
holy fuck
Why is BLNK up bigly!? 🤔🤔🤔
Who's your favorite porn star
if tesla did this yesterday i’d be rich
that is how commodities usually move, they aren't meme stonks
PLTR you can go a little higher bb, just stay under $29.75. 😘

Solid play, dont feel like holding anything but pltr for more than a year tho
when to buy baba call? this anti trust sht aint nothing probably... idk... for US when they did to fb and goog... nothing happened...
Just a dollar fiddy
&gt;Seeing as today is the EOW..... Jesus id have a nice Christmas.
0dte TSLA 680
Same here. When will we see the movement back to $29 that we were promised?   “RKT $100 EOY 🚀🚀🚀” was the biggest scam of the year
Red is Russia’s favorite color
Lol this is not helping
Baba is kill
Stop being a POS $CRSR
Ur mom
I'm pretty sure AMD $100 is like the fabled MSFT $200
Don't catch a falling knife.
On the bright side, sounds like it can’t get any worse. Time to get off this sub, get out of your shitty relationship, and start saving your money again. Bluntly put, you clearly aren’t good at trading options or managing risk, so disable that on your broker. Life is full of ups and downs. This is a down for you, but you gotta get yourself together to turn it around. Merry Christmas
When Tesla rallies after red days it RALLIES. Plus we get the bonus of it being a holiday and news is relatively decent so chances are yes if it’s dated for longer than today.
I bought net for the first time yesterday
Don't hold
bullish
You lost money on GME?  Lol how?!?
Amd release a statement, say your chips cure cancer, say you know what’s in chic fil a sauce, anything idc anything
Yes, hold
Wow, IWM actually dropping as SPY goes up. What kind of upside down day is this?
How the hell did you manage to do that on GME this week? Lol
I’m in an abusive relationship with BABA
Get the fuck in TSLA now
Can SNAP run pls?
Trusting China, not even once.
Just woke up...F for baba gang
You can fix it bro, I trust you. Take this opportunity to improve yourself and bounce back hard. If you didn't already, break up with her/him man. I've made the same mistake of staying with someone for too long because love bewitched me, it may hurt in the short term but it'll be a massive growth opportunity for you in the long term.
$SBE  own the FB of charging network. (chargepoint)  biggest platform.
I left him, but i still think about him everyday. Will he take me back?
This. However still too cheap even factoring in that
Cloudflare‘s real strength is during sector weaknesses. It might never pump like CRWD, FEYE, ZS, FSLY but it always keeps going up.
NIO is so stressful on red days
yumm....xiao long bao
Nah it just swings hellas, hold for a long or don’t play it
lol it’s dated today
XL just bounce Jesus Christ
TSLA is undervalued. Mark it!
When was the last time anyone saw Jack Ma alive?
Thanks bro... need all the help i can get
Hey just letting you know that a BABA 12/31 230p was .30 yesterday nows it’s $14.00 lulz
Mia
AAPL and TSLA to Mars in a Joint Venture?  It's Happening.
Sitting at support at 227 look for upward movement just in case it loses support
Yeah I bought calls earlier this week. My bad.
Damn I have lost A LOT (for me) of money today
I too like being drilled
They aren’t even down a percentage point. Chill.
And here is where SPY puts are peak value
If you have to ask, then yes
why is MRNA going down?  for awhile now
So much profit taking on LGVW
Facts. 1/3 my account in March call spreads. This is way oversold. The CEO of Alibaba is trying to lick XIs boot so hard. Plus, it’s worth more if broken up anyway 🤷‍♂️  CCP officials probably buying in at better prices.
Took profit the put it back in
AAPL!!!!!!
Sure, why not. Everyone believes in it...
*bonk!*
[removed]
Your sister
dame tim apple color me impressed
Buh bye BABA baby, looks like Jack Ma got cucked by Xi for Xmas
Ur dad
How?
Different product than BYND but I have hundreds of warrants and shares. Could see this doubling in 21
I dunno China is different but gl
At this point, how RKT dropping a surprise anymore?
Best stock for quick call gains within the next 1-2 months?
I know we’re all retards here but don’t be that type of retard
what's your favorite mathematical constant
&gt;GME  no, just landing for its next payload to Mars. All in on shares for me.
STIC 😉😉
Who knew that in these troubling times, elon daddy’s lap would be a safe haven
Ramen Noodle crafts bud.  Times are now tough.
No , we just clearing $100 support
Let’s get those BABA calls !! 🤑
Merry Christmas!       -Tesla
SOL 🐂
🍆🍆🍆
Loading up on more GME shares, just going up and down lol
Hopefully you didn’t buy weeklies. There’s so much dd out there and the consensus is that it could happen any time in the next 3 months and most likely will be bursts at a time leading to the big squeeze.
WHat's next week for MSFT look like?
Paper handed my aapl 120 jan15 I'm so sorry mr Apple man, merry Xmas I'll buy more calls next yr
Just waiting on that good ol fcel run up 📈
I don't watch porn any more. I can only jack it to the stock market now Buying at the top and watching my money vanish gives me the same sense of erotic embarrassment as being cucked  Don't even need a girlfriend for this
Any day now. Any. Day. Just split the stock ffs
NET always bounces back hopefully some of you bought that dip
You gotta be extra special to lose on GME
Per fucking usual, the stocks I’ve sold this week are up, the stocks I’ve held onto are down.
Anyone know anything about HRTX?
when is that GME short squeeze y'all keep talking about?
V F F - CGC buyout rumours!?!
So JACK MA will be remembered for sharing that interview with Elon Musk.
sbe carrying my folio on its back today
Holding FCEL, NIO, SRNE, VLDR, PLTR - see you boys next year
Comrade 🙏
Yeah TSLA TO 690! 🚀 🚀 🚀 🌕🌕🌕
Let's go Tezla. 🌈🐻🐻 in shambles.
TSLA FDS BACK IN PLAY BABY
Bought. Will buy more if I need to. Call spreads in March.
How could you not FOMO into AAPL? They’re the greatest cash generating company of all time AND an EV stock.
How much money did congress get to pocket by extending their overtime and getting nothing done in the end?
I’m with ya. down 30% atm but I’m hopeful, as long as it happens in the next week or so that’s all I need
Is CRM just going to be flat forever?
Shares
BLNK
Wtf 🐝
Good for you today boomers SPY &gt; ARK but YTD? ARK 🚀🚀🚀&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; SPY
China gonna wrist slap BABA at best and we all know it will rebound, only question now is timing the entry point
Alright Ameri-jokes, Europoors have finally gotten done a Brexit deal.  Sign a damn stimulus bill into action already.
And there's the other half of what APHA gained yesterday.
One of the reasons this spac is going places
My two biggest share holdings 🥰
all \*my money
2+2=7
Good thing I bought Feb calls so I can wait
the next thing after BABA investigation would be delisting from HK exchange 🤡🤡
Just woke up... why is BABA down 14%?
Remind me to never do secret Santa with Xi. He gives the worst presents.
🤔
57k a head
Wise to average in.   Doubt it sees 200.   One of those everyone is waitinf for it to get there to buy scenarios. Often doesn't materialise
Isn’t it ATH right now ?
TSLA cock slappin all the weak hands across the face wit dat huge hulk green dick!
Im about to go on skipthegames and get some throat. BABA April 16 $460c x10
Thx to whoever tipped me off on GOEV - up like -12% so far!
I don’t like this game anymore I’m gonna go play doom instead
Not going to be delisted, I bought call spreads in March.
Imagine holding BABA calls and not hedging🤡🤡
c
Mia Melano and Mia Malkova. Two goddesses 😍
I am mistake? That’s what my mom keeps telling me as well😢
ALIBAB WHY U GOTTA BE SO RUDE !!  Don’t  u know I’m human too !!

Papa Elon always has open arms as long as you got money.
Tsla HIT 675 TODAY PLS ELONG MUST
Otm so expansive, what you looking at
look at SENS boys and girls
Another fake pump, you sly muthafucker....
Holy crap
Plancks
Message me if you want to discuss your situation
Absolutely disgusting
BJ of UK claims to have a great deal with EU so it is definitely not great, any details out from any third party who has seen the deal yet?
Why should I buy shares when warrants are available?
next year
What happened with that BB insider trading 7.5 call guy?
Yea I wanted to get in but missed it already. :(
Have you considered...looking at the last 3 or 4 daily candles? That's what a short squeeze looks like
What BABA price correlates to 1tril market cap? Like 310$ right?
Calls or puts bruh?
The new law about owning Chinese stock that supports the Chinese army is scaring US investors off the china market entirely
🎶 GME is freeee. Free falling. 🎶
Account just hit a 52week high of 42.2k 🤧
Merry XiMa everyone
Sq making a comeback
It's holding pretty well  Set a stop loss at 16.5 so I'm chillin
SNOW finishing at 330 today
All I want for Christmas is a $69,420.69 RH account balance
Hoping FEYE bounces off of $22 today and retests $25 next week
has to just be free money right?
Dude he declared it
i know some of you bought baba at 300. show us
Didn’t know the grinch owned a hedge fund
Yes my rycey will go up $0.02 toot toot
Ye@h i am dumb for expecting otherwise
Google it
What happens after a double bottom? Triple bottom lol
Wow MASS is on a tear, was gonna buy that shit on IPO day but it had already doubled before open
He lied to us
Imagine holding baba calls at all
Baba 50% of my Roth :(
correct
Total gamble but buying some nkla shares at these levels
FCEL getting nice and stable for one last rip up b4 christmas 🚀🚀🚀🚀
Should I buy more ARKG even though it’s up 20% this month
Yup, sold my calls yesterday because I didn't believe. FML.  12/31 calls? Maybe some 750s?
except for the one that holds companies working on giving us wings.
you think 1/22 200$ puts are free money??? just wait until you try 1/15 140$ puts!!!
Why would anyone keep money in it.  Anyone with a brain dumped after the run
Screw it. I'm going for as much leverage as possible. It's the only way to keep up with inflation. Cashing out my 401k to buy TQQQ calls on a portfolio margin account using box spreads to fund my account and not witholding any taxes to maximize account balance.
Well Santa rally was a crock of shit
Do it faster.
Ofc the only tech stonk I have calls expiring today is taking a dump
Rag pluh
PDD calls were 50 baggers. Fuck fuck fuck      I was an idiot to buy leaps instead (2x on them)
bro just buy more on the dip,
Am I the old tard still going hard on DKNG? Everyone else just talking about GME and BABA
IWM all over the place
CRSR is one moody bitch
what happens in 2027?  did you come from the future to warn us?  WHAT DID YOU SEE?
Is m vis dead?
sell before lock up on 29/12. its gonna unlock alot of shares
LOL  Yes, the like 4 consoles per store. The low margin consoles without disk drives. Massive boon!!!
FUBO pleas fly again 🥺
The Tesla Apple!
Lol right ? I think it was yesterday
 [$TSM](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TSM&amp;src=cashtag_click)  Put/Call: 2092/12k
AMD  *Snip, Snap, Snip, Snap*  Do you have any idea of the physical toll this bears on a person??
If it closes and I’m not in the red I’ll be able to relax for the rest of the holidays. 🤞🏼
Mia
Baba -14%  Party City -4%  I'll let you do the math
Yes
Serious question  I bought some palantir shares at close yesterday and the price paid was 30.83 - what the fuck?? It's never even hit 30?? market order
Is it?
WAS TOLD THERE BE $GME SQUEEZE AND TENDIES??
As much as I like green, it’s the red that has the potential for tendies
God the red on my portfolio hurts.  Fucking FB ain't even helping fuck
well have you? once you do the top is in
shares? yes
No ones looking, it's going up...
I know some of you PLTR bulls didn't meet your quota of 69 rocket emojis yesterday and that's why we're not mooning.  Shame on you.
It’s a Christmas miracle! The NET calls I bought yesterday at the dip are printing. Merry Christmas retards!
new here. $20 a good entry price?
Guys buy BABA
Is nvax a dicey company?
Cant wait for GOEV to never be investigated for this pump and dump!
I felt this
I’ll make this easy   **FCEL** is free money as it runs up to its biggest battery showcase its ever had jan 16 and It’s in their with the big boys like BLNK and sbe. This will hit $20 by then and I don’t think you’ll see another dip like this.. just want us all to have some Christmas tendies
and buy back after the dip ! you're welcome and merry christmas
Theta + my calls = $0
Blood
pleas fly again
Ow
is 🐝 any good to get in anymore?
coiling
So now we’re silent on GME, GME gang 1/15 Calls we holding strong through the new year?  Still think we might have a rally today? Anyone getting out today then hopping back in Monday?
TSLA flying again 😍
I want to go in BABA now. Pleas stop me
You gotta gamble those 0.2k away real quick if you want reddit points.
RIP in peace bro
I'm done with Chinese stocks. The Chinese government can literally do what they want and what they please, BABA can go to $0 if it wanted to. Sold my calls out of fury, have a nice day.
Why does baby grinch look exactly like Mitch McConnell
Baghold VALE $19c 3/19?
Listening to [China's National Anthem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UctriMuXYS0) as the CPC seizes my portfolio.
Fuck Chinese gov fuck communism fuck baba
Did you collect two of every retard?
Just got in Baba right now at 10:36. It won’t go any lower I feeeeel. Bless lord Buddha, holy Allah, Son of Jesus Christ, almighty Krishna.
Is PLTR breaking out soon or what?
That’s a cool idea for your kids, I always appreciated the trips and stuff my family did way way more than any gifts.    He’s a difficult guy, doesn’t like concerts or shows, doesn’t drink, doesn’t have any real hobbies I could get something for (besides golf which he buys himself everything). I already got him satellite radio for his TSLA so I just need something else to actually give him on Christmas cause he likes having something to open. I’m thinking something else for his TSLA like a trunk organizer or something idk. I’ll figure it out lol.
Hey, at least they all could agree on something!
I bought a shitty condo for 390k worth 490-515k now in around 27 months. Nice zip code in Bay area.
are y'all really bullish on GME, like in reality?  Did you even listen to the earnings call...????
Happy Cake Day!
GME gang?🚀🚀🚀
I can tell you it wasn’t going to be at open 😂
What did you make of it when it was 50% HIGHER just a couple months ago...
Just dropped 100K on BABA. Overreaction to its finest. Let’s fucking go
Wooo go TSLA 🚀🚀🚀
BABA has rage quit
AAPL KEEP GOING, I CANT AFFORD THIS LOSS  [https://ibb.co/n1CxKhd](https://ibb.co/n1CxKhd)
BABA and BIDU going to be pegged at the same price next week
Aapl slightly elevated but not quite moon!
NOOOO HIT 30 TODAY
Doo it! I did.
Is it still a good buy? Missed jack alots post rip
Jesus MVIS
Kinda boring
Goev is pathetic. Shouldve sold it yesterday.
got a better idea.
Buying $440 calls on Baba expiring in 2022
Imagine asking that like any retard on here knows the future
Wtf GOEV
would have been tough to get a fill anyway
Hold or sell PLTR for loss?
My mvis calls are freeeeefallllinnnnngg
Big PUMP and DUMP.
It’s not a solid trading day unless my CRSR long gets fucked hard
[removed]
Melt up on low volume, got it
Dude no... lmao so many other plays out there
Brooooooo this hits different. PLTR 29c 12/24
Buy dip
they said gaming on CNBC..
DA hasn’t come through yet so probably yea. Depends how long you are holding for
I lost money on XL 🤡
Hope so, and I'm out of day trades.
i sold at 1400 shares at 18, back in at 17. Hopefully a nice rise to eod.
It's a distraction, go buy some other goodies...
how much would i. make off a 675 call expiration that’s today in TSLA, it only costed me 50$
Yeah, definitely. People are expecting a big boost Monday (it probably won’t be big but I imagine around $22 point).
Please slap me again lord elong
Volume has been steadily declining
Y’all really forgot it’s down like 8% over the last 2-3 days
Net is mooning like it’s 1969
Calls but fuck it looks like it’s being pinned down around 227
You gonna make BANK
Just barely hit my entry level on MVIS.
Just woke up god dam baba
MY MAN I WAS WAITING TO SEE YOU POP UP IN HERE💦💦💦
We’ll I’m playing 6/18 debit spreads
Don't worry guys Xi is totally cool, and rational he won't over reach and nationalize BABA.
I bought 2 shares at $220...and 2 more set for $215   Retarded? maybe but LFG!!!!!!!!
Free free fallin’
F
When do they expire
Share or call/put? Expiry?
Fuck it just broke support
This guy
SQ enough pls. I can only get fucked so hard it hurts too much
It's just hype
CHRISTMAS MIRACLE. TESLA, APPLE MOONING AND GME EATING SHIT !
Um mvis? Lolol
Why arent my all-in NKLA calls printing?
Yeah! It’s still really early I’m buying again @ 17
Hedgeye on buying BABA dip:   &gt; Buying it? We're Bearish on $BABA as anyone who did real research should have been  &gt; @HedgeyeChina  https://twitter.com/KeithMcCullough/status/1342128154815717376
I got FGKW just upset that they are not moving north
DA hasnt even dropped yet man stop being a bitch
Tesla, please keep creeping up.
No options. 700 stocks bought around 28.95
It's gonna dump soon
Its gonna take some time to read through all the details, hold tight. Details will emerge next 2-3 days.
The market is literally bear traps til the end of the pandemic.
Are bars open in DC?
Long term it should recover. I wanna buy options tho
JOE just keeps going up
Is PLTR hittin 30 today?
I just got fucked man I’m so sad
Reminder fellow small fish. RH will close out your options if you don’t have enough money to buy the number of stock one hour before close. Might see a dip around that time.   TSLA 670 by 1155 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
People actually use market orders?
I could have sold yesterday at 700% but I wanted that 10 bagger.
Shares or calls?
Go back to bed
FLueNT? Thoughts?
That's what you get for joining hands with those fucking commies.
count your fingers
Hold your shares how are you going to paper hand this one
Saw that ark was buying surface oncology a few days ago so started to look at it.. They have a new deal with GSK that has potential for them to receive $700 million, and yet their entire market cap is less than $400 million. Am I missing something or would that imply that they are very undervalued at current price?
Gonna need like...a LOT of things to turn around today.
Gonna be a huge rip leading into its Jan showcase
Agreed. Avg down heavy here
Painful to own those shits.  However selling now is literally selling when there is max fear. Not a good idea
next ER is gonna move it bigly
forex is too complicated for us.
Elon Musk and Tim Apple had sex and gave birth to Santa Claus.
Shitron- fuck nio because I'm a cuck and salty about missed gains and want a better entry price 😭😭😭  Nio📉📉📉📉  Shitron- XL fleet amazing price target 60 😊😊🤗  Xl📉📉📉   Petition for shitron to keep the cok in there mouth and just stfu about my positions😡😡😡
Canadian market about to get flooded with liquidity &amp; play money from the Ontario lockdown... any picks?
BABA 225 expiration today worth a punnt?
Time for the bounce
Fuck it bought lottos for next week. Cannot believe I sold my 12/24s yesterday to see them ITM today, FML
Dump that SHITSTAIN of a stock and put your money into VALUE stocks bro
Well, it’s twice as good!
Stop. F you CCP &amp; Xi.  Wait a week for dip to consolidate
[removed]
For real.
XL on sale. Was 35 this morning. 29 now. Due for a reversal.
rip your money
Buy fear on $BABA?  Let's assume Xi brings the epic commie shit storm of hellfire down on BABA due to Jack Ma?  Aren't companies often worth more piecewise than as a whole?  Investors in BABA will get shares of all of the spinouts, which is typically what happens when a monopoly is broken up, although I'm not entirely quite sure what happens with a Chinese company.   People who had AT&amp;T got shares in all of the Baby Bells after AT&amp;T got broken up.  It ended up being very profitable.
I predict more contract announcements leading up to earnings will be the breakout catalyst. People will realize the short term valuation concerns are nothing compared to the snowball potential.
I believe in omnichannel with all my heart
Christ was Jewish and it's his birthday this week
The VA
i held but sold a little early for like 20% profit because i didn’t want to be holding 0dtes for too long then i bought that exact strike
Search for long profit calculator on google.
Youre paddling the wrong way, Canoo!!!
How can we let someone from one of the most shithole states and poorest in America be in charge of the American people 🤡
Sold Apple for BABA 2 months ago 🧑🏻‍🦯
Give me a better hint for the ticker lol
TSLA you fucking beauty
Imagine doubting papa musk 😉
Being investigated for breaking monopoly laws in China. It’ll pass as even Xi knows Alibaba is one of China’s best companies
Pltr and gme make me buuuust😭😭😭
Positions?
Hold, then if you're ready sell when it hits 29 again on Monday. Shit's predictable at this point.
no doubt  bulls are gonna rush for the exit as soon as it goes -5% lol  That's the problem with meme stocks with dog shit fundamentals
Those bastards lied to me.
Sell calls you silly goose.
jesus fuck lost 5% today
Being investigated for breaking monopoly laws in China. It’ll pass as even Xi knows Alibaba is one of China’s best companies
100k pesos?
maybe, life in prison
Visit China  Before China visits you 🇨🇳
Is this real?
BIGC looks like it's about to live up to its name.
What broker?
Any nnoxers in the chat
# dont stop 🍉
feel bad for anyone with 12/24 BABA calls...yikes. I feel bad enough for myself w shares.
what should i do, i have a 675 call exp today
They haven't even merged yet of course
Hold that shit. It’s not going anywhere.
Keep going on GOEV mms I got a lot more money to buy these dips
Are IWM puts free money or too good to be true? Seems like a prime short target
Fuck today. Happy holidays y’all
Their earnings are gonna be monster.  If they come out next year and confirm they are working on a car watch this shit skyrocket
Hope so for calls
You think it’ll bounce back?
Being investigated for breaking monopoly laws in China. It’ll pass as even Xi knows Alibaba is one of China’s best companies
 dropped 200k on baba avg down
Like.. delisted. $0
dude you got in so late

This just in, NKLA developing a new zero emission drill!   They say it will drill to the earth's core and it's powered entirely their stock price!
Thanks gaybo!
Yup just purchased a leap for next August / merry Chrima to me
**fuck you im not selling shit**
Are TSLA and ARKK inversely related or some shit lmao
Easily should have parked the money into FCEL, ipo-c or g hiv
Let's hope so
I wonder what happened to that one guy who shorted TSLA at 600 with all of his money.
CCL LEAPS. Why not? Easy money?
Why the fk is Bloomberg covering this Europoor Brexit thing?
That’s the daily question for the past month, followed by eod dump :(
I sold
So about that TSLA selloff....
thick boy
Elon-you will make a believer of me yet  TSLA-MARS🚀   Bianca
I think 125B is fair. I find it hard to put a value on SQ though, it’s potential it’s clear but how much that potential is worth is hard to determine.
that's a lie lol
The rug pull on XL this morning was evil. Up 7% before open and goes down 10% at open? Smfh
Lol bro come on
Upvote if you bought TSLA today  Downvote if you bought BABA today
I am a STIC/BARK shareholder not by choice now.
Tesla just gonna keep sucking even after I’m done.
CRM ✨sucks✨
F
volume so low.. also sbe took off wtf.. can’t believe i sold at 38
SELL AND BUY BACK AT 30
Hit with antitrust by the chinese government
GME wedge...get ready🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Oh my TSLA 0DTE calls are duckin printing
I’m all in 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
I could have made 10 grand today but I pussied out, never again.
where were you at 9:40 damn
My tsla calls are slowly coming back from the grave. Just need another big day to bring iv back to what they were 😂
RH will sell your calls automatically. So lock in your gains or let it roll
Just a big dolla fiddy dildo
Yeah, I was there and watched my hands turn to diamonds when it dropped. It's a massively shorted stock that is undervalued because boomers just take it as face value "blockbuster lol" and ignore that gaming as a market is booming and GME has a huge foothold and by increasing their offerings, service, ecommerce platform and brand they could turn things around massively. We just need young money RC at the helm to drive this spaceship.
My TSLA call I sold yesterday only up 300% today :(
Bought, join us on this burning ship so if it fails I don't feel as alone in my poor choices.
Feels good to be making money before the new year but I'm still shocked we aren't red af off of the news in Washington. Not complaining tho
Aapl deal w NIO more likely to happen now than with TSLA
Why does Berkshire get no love when Apple skyrockets? BRKB is effectively a managed Apple etf
When do they learn?
AAPL has hit 134 and retreated thrice
I gotta get out of GOEV.  This is fucking ridiculous
Don't say I didn't tell you about SENS
Everything in Canada is basically a microcap if it's not Shop, NVEI, energy or a bank
I can’t remember the last time I saw the colour red in my portfolio.
Strike and exp?
Sell if you have paper hands; it’s a long term hold now.
A dip after inclusion was expected. A flight after the dip was not a given.
I would rather let these fucking options expire than let the MM's win and sell  EDIT:  Oh fuck that is exactly how they win....
So frustrating
FUBO wow
Stock market become sentient AI
I see y'all bought that THCB dip
Fuck $SQ really. Wtf is this bleeding? I exited my position
If what happened
what’s your suggestion lol
No. We can only crawl until the MM's has shaken out enough gamblers.
Did jack ma not bow before the supreme leader Winnie the Pooh as suggested by WSB?
Could also be worthless
I'm staying in for the long run
You got in too late
Yeah that’s why I said it hit my entry price. I got filled at $6 and it bounced back to $6.20 immediately. Just barely caught it.
Anyone else getting bent over by baba?
You and half of this sub.
It's china!!!!! Not the US, there won't be a break up it will become part of the CCP and jack ma will end up in a camp.
☝️this guy gets it
Thank you AMD, I guess I’m having porter house steak for dinner tonight
GE gang checking in
Its a joke and a half
no, MM will not let 29k open interest on 30c get ITM
 4 1/2 years later.. mcconnel of xmas future maybe
NGA. Canadian stock. Going to the moon
It’s the closest thing they can find to the world is ending
Yeah. Did you? Current management is already doing a decent job of cutting costs and refocusing on what makes money. RC will expand on that and the console cycle will be a catalyst for enormous earnings growth. As a multiple of revenue it’s trading like a short term bankruptcy risk, which it definitely is not.
It just ends up being invested in U.S. tech stocks or booze. The booze in Ontario is sold through government stores.
Please GME go up
Apple and Tesla carrying SPY on its back rn 🥴
I know AMZN is a complicated business but can anyone explain its sideways movement the past few months ?
Who’s holding RYCEY? Our payday should be imminent. London Stock Exchange is closed right now. The rolls Royce stock trading on LSE affects the RYCEY stock right?
Buy high sell low. I love that game. I master it every time
You YOLOing retards were truly the greatest gift of them all
Got one at 17.10 just to remind me its there, going to average down if it dips. I see more short term downside, like BFT
Bof
BABA starting to flatten out. Preparing to start moving back up or continue to fall further. Stay tuned.
RIP
Yeah Apple might keep pushing today anyway the rest of the day so you’ll probably be good. I’m deciding now if I wanna take the profit in my Apple call and roll it into ICLN calls
This is a long play. It’ll grow huge next year
Every other day this week
When the volume on your covered call is so bad that the spread makes no sense so you’re down 1k and the underlying stock is down 2k. Logic.
Sure looks like it’s getting pinned at $29.
Cathie on holidays already???? Get back to work pleas
Is there any reason to hold my 1/15 GOEV calls right now...
Where do you idiots find these tickers
will nio go back up for nio day?
Fuck yea
GME contract down 93%.....really hope this squeeze happens or there goes my entire port
Where the fuck are all you AMD retards at ? We all know this shit is drilling below 90. Why is it even trying to pump
But, chinese stock.
If AAPL hits $134 an hour before market close it will truly be a Christmas miracle for me 🍏🚀
[removed]
All in BABA April calls
I think it'll do good after Christmas weekend tho
No chance. We're lucky if it hits 29 again today
Because investors are stupid
Sending GOEV CALLS 💎✋🏻I want these tendies bois
Thank you for the free tendies vouchers
Finally been day trading TSLA with positive results thanks to the trailing stop loss. Wish I could go back March and do the same for all my trades.
No
I am ready to hop into GOEV with both feet, just gotta wait for it to stabilize out a bit first haha, keeps cruising down
you speak no lies  RKT is trash
ok GME, you dont have all day to go up and down all day
SNE please fly again
Buy High Boys for life
TSLA really wanna run today eh
BABA!!!! STOP, STOOOP! ITS ALREADY DEAD!
BLNK is mooning $30C 3/19
FCEL about to rebound. All aboard 📈💸
Anyone else set the limit price of worthless OTM options for something outrageous?  Maybe an algo will severely mess up and I get $5,000.
Apple is an auto stock now.  So technically Apple.
He fear no one
Eh it’s not impossible. God speed soldier
i would be happy with 29
Buy the GEOV dip, $30 Q1 2021 💪
I have reverse Midas touch. I even lost money on Lemonade

Goev what the fuck?

Great dd, retard

Gotta be
Who do Melvin think they’re fooling? The jig is up, Melvin. We putting our dick in the mashed potatoes.
You’ll drive 70 miles to buy CDs that won’t work in next gen consoles?    I’m buying, sounds like it will moon.
my bad, bought ark c at close
No I believe in MA we go to moon got some lottos
That’s what you idiots get for funding the commies. I prefer to lose my money on AMZN, BUD, and MCD like a real American
Stop the count!

What was your worst trade for the year? Mine was just recently...lost 14k on fedex calls
PRPLLLLL
Whoever said to get TSLA 665c yesterday was genius. Unfortunately I passed.
Yea.. I should cool down. I will just sit out today . If it reaches 200 I will go in tho.
The $8 price target, and the $50 and $60 price targets ignored.
Thank you tesla sold my 655 calls for a nice gain. Have a nice holiday everyone. Especially everyone who is alone, I feel for you and hope you have a nice time.
That’s exactly why that beesh off limits
who bought FUBO at the top lmaooo rip
[removed]
Surprising no one is talking about the $2000 stimulus vote failing in the house..
The amount of VLDR GOEV fucking cocksucker pumpers that comment 5000 times a day and disappear lost people an insane amount of money the last few days.
damn so the MVIS rally is over??
I can’t resist. ALL-in on 12/31 BABA 240s
XL is gonna moon again BUY THE DIP
My mom doesn't want me playing with you guys anymore, she says youre dumb and make me lose my allowance
Zuck put his Scrooge mask on
I’m holding until next year. I’ve lost a lot already. 💎🙌🏼 baby! It’s a Christmas thing issue. Once the defense act passes I think it’ll soar to the moon!
Short weeks should give you your day trades used last Friday.
I didn’t know it was this kind of party
Well it for a little profit. That will drop like a rock into closing.
Always hold ETFs
So it will either go up or it will go down? Got it.
PLTR 12/31 $30 is free money
How far out are y’all getting your BABA calls for? July?
I have been looking at them too. Wondering the same
Stop selling XL my god it has dipped enough
Sell it. I am sure Cramer asking to take profit is coming up.
FB. They are gonna crush earnings
ARKK green when TSLA red and vice versa.
Any reason HYLN still falling? Not seeing any news
Anyone know when S B E will turn into ChargePoint?   Charge Point is the largest EV charging company around the globe.
I give up on the market this week
i just need sq to end green pls santa
8% wtf you smoking, 695 all time high... it’s down like 4-5% lol
Lol so brave. What did u buy? Shares?
BABA settling at 220. Get your calls in
Thanks for the insight
FUBO sounds like brazilian street soccer, what the fuck were you thinking buying it after +110% in a month.
[removed]
It’s hit 30 before but that was days/weeks ago. Could be wash sale? This your first time buying PLTR or did you buy and sell before yesterday at all?
MVIS was always a fake pump. They don't do automotive lidar.
CRM stop being autistic and be like your cousin AAPL
I bought BABA 220C weekly. pray for me!
LOL
tiny spy crash incoming in 60mins IMO, so buy calls
I got out of PLTR because I was losing my ass so I invested yesterday in some BABA LEAPS assuming it was less risky. I feel like I won the opposite of the lottery.
Bounce It
NNOMF in agreement with Tesla 🚀🚀🚀
I gotta say, these daily threads suck as sentiment indicators
RAVEN!!! What’s your problem........
What’s the juice on BLNK? 🤔🤔🤔
Hold or sell RYCEY
Dude genomics is the future lmao, just really think about it. ARKG is going to 300 in 2 years 100%
why would you hold 0dte on GME please tell me you're memeing
Drops on robinhood look way more dramatic than it really is. Except for BABA that shit going to 50
LCY from Tillman entry point, 1B market cap 🤑🤑

PLTR just getting its rocket warmed up and breaking out of wedge formation
TSLA TO MARS!!!!!! GET FUCKED MICHAEL BURRY!!!!!
FUBU up next
Sold FUBO at 34 yesterday.  Looking to get back in.
It was down like 8% before today’s move
Anyone selling covered calls on PLTR? Got tons of shares and am thinking this could be a good idea with how flat it’s been. Any thoughts?
?? Canoo is an amazing EV company that's been talked about for a month or so
I take it back I got scared
💯 I think it’s oversold here. It sold off on antitrust concerns a month ago too.
Thanks, I think I'll stay on daily Riot Plays.
E O S E profit taking today...
Almost like 90% of ARKK is not TSLA
Citron got me twice,  once on NIO once on PLTR, for about 60k overall
How much you wanna bet this is just political theater and pony show for Baba?  Xi is flexing on BABA to show everyone never, ever fuck with the communist party, but at the same time, they don't want to scare the bejesus of out investment, especially into the tech sector, which is wear China is desperately trying to overtake the US.    It's a monopoly anal probe.  It'll probably result in nothing, but 'reform' recommendations in the end.  Just a big political show.
BABA is fine. This is maximum pain. They will fine and ease the handling, for they are buying shares right now. Communists love money as much as you do.
DONT.
I just rolled down the strikes on my BABA calls in some pathetic futile attempt to get just a little bit of delta in case this is the bottom.  I am like an abused spouse that just keeps giving my man one more chance.  It is just fucking sad.... please everyone avert your eyes.  😔😔😔
THCB the ticker isn't banned anymore
The $8 Price target damage. The other price targets are irrelevant apparently.
Yes. They announced: declining YoY revenue, worse than expected earnings, increased store closures. Filed for a 100M shelf offering which they will surely be using soon. Good e-commerce growth but 300% of a small number isn't that relevant.  As a multiple of revenue it's trading like a shitty B&amp;M store with bad growth prospects lol
Don't buy GME dip. It won't be the last. I don't want to see you guys get hurt
for today! was down -4% on my portfolio, now -11% all time woo!
oof
#HOW IS PTON AT 165 😂😂😂
Papa Elon please goto 670 in the next 30-45 minutes. This will make up for me losing almost everything on battery day. 🙏🙏🙏🙏🚀🚀🚀
It wasn’t at 34 yesterday
Fomo is the one thing we're capable of perceiving that transcends dimensions of time and space. Maybe we should trust that, even if we can't understand it.
Yes but patience. Itll be a good short but too much retard strength rn
I'm experiencing the Xmas theme today, keep bouncing back and forth from red to green on the day.
With this spy dip FCEL has never looked so good. I mean seriously do not miss out my fellow tards
Cloudera ☁️ anyone?
🙏🏾🙏🏾
you bought after it went up 100% in a week?
cuz the market never cared about poor people getting checks
You will likely get a better price, once you place an order to close those calls.
I dont know what a spac is and at this point I'm to afraid to ask, and or google
I’ve got a lot tied up in 60c 2/19.
I’m fucking obsessed with NET
The vix is getting fucked up today
$SQ dip?
BUD is German you commie
I have 8 contracts in play right now.  Going decently...
Thoughts on BABA 2022 LEAPs?
I literally have a race in my portfolio every day to see if WYNN can't overtake AXP. Way more entertaining than whatever work thinks I am doing.
Wow did baba puts fucking print
Fuck I should’ve just bought more meme stocks
Don’t say I didn’t tell you about _____
it went pretty sideways from sep 2018 - mar 2020 as well. i guess covid gave it a huge boost but now its found its footing around 3K again
Always sell CCs
now i know not to - truly never had this issue before I guess I just didn't know - I feel like that's an absurd jump though regardless
Played PLTR perfectly this morn. Cashed out 0dte puts and turned em into call spreads.
That shit had zero chance of getting through the Grim Reaper anyway
Glad to see Baba take a shit after it absolutely fucked me and dumped a quarter of my account in one day in August for no fucking reason   Think it was like august 6 or 7
funny last week i posted blnk and plug, and my message got banned because blnk wasn't 1b market cap and now it is lol
Planitar pleas fly
Another new buyer just put $400k into GME. https://twitter.com/TradesEmpire/status/1342132882383503361

Whatever bro
[removed]
Covered calls always a good idea 🤷🏽 win win
Baba shares will be better than any sort of calls or leaps imo, took years for it to rebound back in 2017-2019.
But MVIS dip??
Agree to disagree
Yep this will be a good one once people realize that
Did you dump your entire portfolio into 0dtes?
This market is beyond fucked. I have March SPY calls that are dropping 3-5% a day with SPY fucking green.
holyyyy sign me up to your newsletter. I feel like its too high for me to day trade with now
Alexa play Flight of the Bumblebee  🐝
That blows. Pltr has been my cash cow just writing cc’s
But 10% of the time, it matches every time.
Today is such a bad day
Mods banned sir jack a lot but I think his dd was actually legit. This thing has potential. Just started trading a few days ago and when more people catch on this is gonna fly
Well it might go sideways too
Yes please Chamath said SLACK was a steal and they going big
Three day rule, just wait for IV to cool
I was excited last night to buy into the dip today 😕😕
Give it up, BABA.  You're not going to stay above $220.
If it’s fucking stocks why would you dump it? Literally just hold it dumbass
Volume is so low only poor people are trading.
PLTR lost its rocket a month ago :(
If you’re not buying this huge baba discount, you’re retarded
jesus that dude who was pumpin Barkbox yesterday.
March 19 bull call spreads (Bought at the money, sold one out). Try to buy between the bid-ask.
PLTR 🚀
All FEYE holders. 💎🙌🏼 baby! Don’t let the shake n bake fool you. We flying after Christmas 👏🏼👏🏼

I had it probably a month ago??
Who else bought BABA 220C weeklies?  Am i the only degenerate on this board?
bagholding VALE $20c 4/16.....
No I’m not that retarded, got in at about 5.50$ went to 9.50 got greedy and didn’t sell and now I’m about at where is started
To Valhalla, thoughts on a possible run up still today? Or just brace for impact? Hold my beer
Give me a 0tde!!!
Uhhhh
None of these idiots know what a short squeeze looks like, all weak hands talking. Check out Volkswagen in Oct 2008.
Go PDD !!!

It’s me, the guy who is gonna buy baba calls at the bottom. Gods speed fellows
I was calling it when I bought it at .92 per. Bought more this morning at .80
The fuck is CRM dumping for?
Just want to say screw NIU
SBE 🚀🚀🚀🚀
PRPL having a day.
Say what you will about China, The US looks way more retarded. This country would be up in flames if it wasn't for Jpow.
Why you ask BABA dropped so much? Because retails are panic selling BABA to buy meme stocks, institutions are on vacation
Fuck you!
who's buying BABA with me?
Been watching it &amp; missed that big pop smh
💎👏🏻
We all getting IV crushed
I would say anywhere near 200s
Holy fuck I'm rich
Who was buy fucking puts?? It was at a 6 month low with insane fundamentals.
All I want for Christmas is for someone to buy my put spreads on abnb
I'm starting to sadly think that NIO is just this.. up and downs in the mid 40s but that's pretty much it.. probably not a great stock after all even in the long term.
LMAO WHERES ALL THE 🌈 GME HOLDERS NOW
Thats it im never touching spy again fuck this shit
i have $5 someone tell me how to make a quick 100
I was so much happier when I was investing into VTI....
I'm feeling that it's gonna stay in the red today but I'm optimistic we'll see some action getting into January
hey im pretty dumb, whats 0dte
Remindme in 4 weeks
do you have a good link for that ?
Jan 16?   Links?
FCEL 🚀 Looking primed for a nice run up 📈
Li Auto needs a $2-3 dollar swing
Hope they’re shares I’m sure it will come back up....eventually.
No news is why it's falling
I hold PLTR in at 24 just letting it sit tbh but thanks for the advice
FDX being kept down by a thread; what bs
Xinnie the Pooh executed a five finger death punch on everyone’s portfolio
It’s a shit stock that will fall below 10
So glad I bought TSLA calls at open
hold, you could sell covered calls to lower your avg  price
SRAC the real space play 🚀🚀
3 employees in the entire company 🤡
Betting on China being trustworthy...
Definitely looking for an opening in a few weeks, S T I C is a good play but will probably see a pullback under current value I think.
💎🙌
Lets fuckin go. It's volume is so low today though don't trust any price movements
Why is PDD up so much when JD.com is the better company? CCP is going after Baba not JD.
Merry Christmas and happy holidays to all you fellow tards that aren’t seeing family this year. Seriously
thank u santa.....for tsla
right here baby lets get ready to fuk and suk
Hahaha lmao dude I’m in at 144$ u poor TRIGGERD cuck lmao   Look just because your suck at the market   And will be a wage slave your whole life as your youth leaves u   Don’t be mad at me ok   U picked the wrong career and your not talented enough to bring value to a company   Your poor mom who can’t even pay rent now because u are to much of a loser to help her   Worthless
Short NKLA.  That shit will be at 0 in &lt; 1 year.
Just be patient. They are legit. Once everyone realizes it it will moon again to 80+ - double down if you can.
BABA leaps a good idea?
Unless the ones spun out become wholly state owned.  Jack Ma has already told Xie that the government can have any part of BABA it wants.
Yeah you likely got hit with the wash sale rule, look it up, they adjust your cost basis.
You thing SQ gonna go lower into EOD today or is this the dip? I can’t sell if I get in today 😵😵
short squeeze- it's worth more to prop it up and keep it flat than it is to let it drop it seems
Nobody in here is actually gonna hold GME over the holiday weekend, right? Please don’t be that stupid
AUPH taking off 🚀🚀
Never played options before but I could lose $2k quick to offset taxes on unemployment monies which I paid zero on (and used all to buy stocks seen here)... What's move? How to lose $2k but no more before new year?
Hehheh....
Because I’m holding it
IV on PLTR is so high that I just knocked 5% off my entry-price today by selling 7DTE covered calls against them @ $30.  Damn.
Send it to the Nigerian prince in your spam folder
Go buy alone. I won't avg down further.
I fucking hate what this subs become shut the fuck up you peasant
I mean chances are they are still making a profit at this level
got shares.long live BABA
felt this in my soul RIP
Hold these 1/15 pltr $27c’s?
THCB, we can say it now. Also, 🚀🚀🚀🚀.
sell weekly or monthly cc at whatever price you feel good at letting it go
Calls expiring today still up af. Idc lol
2k on 0dte atm spy calls
Dead I'm sure. Their children are going to find a dead body under the Christmas tree tomorrow.
PTON puts anyone?
You’re retarded. China has death camps and social credit scores.
FUCK YEAH BRUH!!!!
Someone put $3.4million into SPWR a day ago. They seem like a solid investment right now considering how low their price is.
positions bitch
Wonder if the price is being depressed on a low volume day tho
Here comes the Christmas Eve surprise
[removed]
STIC about to take off again.
Means it’s prob gonna dump bro.
SBE!!!
You can buy mine
VTI was the free money all along
🤡🔫
Not sure but mine expire in a couple hours and I needed like 20 cents more to win....
nvm figured it out
ev tanking
Zucks a cuck
Venmo me
If you read this have a nice christmas and sit straight you retard.
BABA, play Free Falling.
Why not?
I was +50% on 30c that I bought yesterday morning.  Doubt I'll even be able to see these before the early close lol
Put 2k in GME April calls. You'll lose money 100%
Paid $270 for GME contracts that are now worth $15 lmao....
Ha. It is probably.  I've got a stop loss on it if that tells you anything.  You just need to buy everything you're bullish on when the market has a down day as a whole.  If SPY is dragging EVERYTHING down then buy contracts as far out as you can afford.  I've done it twice now and it's worked out great.
Whew that makes me feel better about my account today
You got it pal!
Same people who would buy calls at the top on overvalued meme stocks 🤡
Find an otm call and buy $2000 worth?
[this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOYMH_lWNa4) is very importante
I am scared too 😱
We've all thought we were buying the BABA dip at one point
You silly silly heretic
I’ve played PDD a few times and I swear it’s the most manipulated gyna
lol for real, you don't lose when you bought the dip in meme stocks, while the CRM dip just keep dipping
A whole week of red. Fuck christmas.
Keep going TSLA🚀🚀🚀
Donate to my charity plz
Big spender
Just joined PLTR gang, feels good man
Fucking hell GME need the squeeze to come ANYTIME NOWWW....
FSR going to the moon all of 2021
AMAZON YOU PILE OF SHIT GO UP
Buy otm calls on any kind of boomer stock
Just bought in for more fun.
What would you guys think of buying BABA For 1/15/21 $250c’s right now?   I know it *sounds retarded* and it *is retarded* but the calls are so cheap right now I’m trying to figure out if I can afford **not** to buy them
Man that Tesla owners forum is toxic. We fight on here a lot but it’s all not serious at all. Those guys are actually beefing over whether the holiday update will be released on time.  Shit ton of fake news too.
QS 😐
Pleas
hep(a) has a good dip right now
I flip calls non-stop. Would not short.
Hold all year free ten bagger
Is CRM just not going to go up anymore because of Slack? This is frustrating
Definitely
I-V-R. Calls were up real nice and meant to close them and instead bought the same amount I had and then BANG... whole thing went to shit.  Also lost a grip to TNKR. Fuck that gang.
I just need gold to make a quick $10 down and then I don’t mess with it again
Oh shit, I think STIC is making another run at it!!!
Jesus christ even puts 8 months out on BABA were at least a one bagger
Sounds like your mom needs some bwc
Ok seems like a good move. Hopefully it doesn’t go down too much..
Those fucks don’t take vacations lmao, they’re always trading while their wives boyfriends take their families on vacation
with your brokerage?
Just playing one meme, or former meme, from now on TSLA.
Call credit spread on tesla
We need Santa to bring us $700 EOD under the tree
 Nah dude more like your fucked you fucking jabroni why even speak
&amp;#x200B;  yeah maybe, but they totally fuck all options holders.
Microvision can lidar my nutsack
For all you retards that need to hear this, do not let the MM's and Algos win, buy the BABA dips. HODOR.
VXX turn around?
$279 seems so far away. sigh.
Wait for it to test 225 again, if it holds I’d buy, if it doesn’t it’ll likely go lower.
Lol stop buying FDs if you can’t take the heat
Well, it can dump by 5% and I'll be fine. Or it can rise and I'll get exercised for profit. Or it can dump further and I can continue lowering my cost basis using covered calls.
Lots of foreclosures hitting the market?
fcell in beginning stages of its daily rip!!
What is going to lead the Santa rally? My money is on STZ, BBBY, and MU for earnings run ups for the start of the year. All consolidating.
If you're not buying call options in BLNK, you have to ask "what am I doing with my life?" Room for MORE upside exists
Buy $TSLA fractions near EOD so you can $ROPE on Monday
I feel like the fact that the CCP can come in and shut them down, or take them over, or do anything they want anytime they want, puts a cap on their value. But I'm an idiot. Probably smart to buy deep otm calls.
When Xi gives BABA his blessing do you think it will just gap up 30% overnight or will it be a slow and steady thing?
If TSLA busts through 665 we're mooning boi
That's why he did what he did
Congrats! I was there once. Then it drove straight down.
I am really starting to hate CRM
I just buy calls on red days (have a lot of shares ~30 something basis) and it’s worked like 80% of the time
I may have bought one of those
I love how much REEEEEEEEEEE ya'll have on .10% candles Christmas Eve.
Wasnt always like that. I bought one in 2013 and the forums used to be civil.
Please pray for my baba 12/31 calls
Do a 2k ish value spread that will never fucking hit. On AMZN or something
I love shopping calls
CRSR needs to go back to $50 again
should i let my apple covered calls be executed? this thing should dip back under $130 right?
Autocorrection got me
It's near its covid low now you don't think they haven't  already scared the vejesus out of investment?
Sold 20% of my position when it hit 20, letting the rest ride to the moon
GME and PLTR you were my most favoured retarded children, but a few weeks back I found a new child wandering the streets and decided to adopt it for a bit, it's name is BLNK - it is so retarded, it really does not know which direction it is going, it tries new things every day, I think I love it.
Investors finally tried Salesforce and realized its an ass system
Green dildo
Please Close The Market
Me niqqa
MT 12/31 25c gonna expire worthless.
with this news i wouldnt reccomend it. this will ripple for at least a few weeks. so that call will probably expire worthless.
That’s what it do.
BABA if you ever want to do the "be greedy when others are fearful and cower". Today is a day. This is Spartaaaaaa.
Buy super OTM SPY 0DTE contracts to the tune of 2k. Not difficult.
Someone who watches TSLA often. Do I sell my 650c expiring today or hold this shit to the end?
Still profiting lmao how's shorting at 16 you homeless fucks
Gonna be a long two hours watching it
Ok Melvin...
Look at the volume on the puts and the return whoever bought was lucky
Fucking christ MVIS should I get out now or hold in hopes of magic carpet rides?
More likely it trades flat at 664 to cuck everyone
When tepper sold some of his shares in November it was a sign
PLUG CALLS
Gme $21c 12/31??
Drill Team 6 has commandeered PLTR
Is GME done with upside or can go up?
Baba holders.....
Fuck everyday.
My boy spy is gonna get his cheeks clapped eod
RIP MY ENTIRE PORTFOLIO
This job fucking sucks
LMAO WHO WOULD SHORT AT 16
PLUG FSR 🚀🚀🚀🚀
pltr you bring shame to your famiri
Anyone else seeing their RH daily gains/losses out of whack on the Homescreen recently?
I’m down $13 today what do :(
It's too late to buy tesla fatties. Leave it. Go PLTR if you have balls or AAPL if you have soft cock syndrome
Thing ain’t gonna test 225 most likely
Kinda want to grab some yolo calls on BABA even though I hate everything Chinese
Jan 9th.
Drill team six incoming in the south southeast sector on GME, over.  Roger that.
it wont go fly again without correction
I'm still bullish but god damn its frustrating waiting on it. Thinking of opening some ITM debit spreads just to make sure I still get paid if it stays level
I mean the bigger picture of investment into the entire country of china.
Thanks BABA. Now I know what it feels like to live in a communist Country
Pleas fly again guy definitely just lost 50k on pinterest today
Worth it perhaps. Will be interesting to see how it trades when everyone returns for new years.  Feb calls might be better though. Or at least buy debit spreads like 240/250C
BABA is actually making a fool outta me. This stock is fundamentally not worth 218 USD dollars
fair enough, I don't have those diamond hands.
TSLA making the index boomers rich
Good news, only down 34k on my naked BABA puts before i sold
I grabbed em
For those who keep buying baba and it keeps dipping... you get what you fucking deserve! - joker voice
Honestly, good luck, I hope they end up ITM. I'd gladly take a 12.5% return on my purchase in 7 days.
I get the feeling  g m e  is about to 🚀🚀🚀 into the close.
Are my VALE 1/15 19c fucked or is the market just red this week. I wanna double down on this dip
I was told GME would be at 30 EOY
Barring a huge collapse I’ll hold. I got in on my 665c for .92 so no reason not to hold. For you depends on how much you paid per contract and how muxh risk you want to take.
Nvda, CRM, Amazon boring as fuck
Going sideways after dropping that much is the first step of a bottom. So you can technically just buy around here with a stop loss under the little channel that it created.   Personally, I have my first buy order around 210 but I'm playing catch the falling knife.
Mine are dead. No point in selling, hoping I can get some back Monday, but 12/31 is dead. Bought a Jun and a LEAP while holding back tears :,(
LMAO I sold my BLNK calls at breakeven bc it was trading sideways for a bit there, and then boom it starts the next leg up to 53
Can someone give me an ELI5 why two of these options are down ~10% while the others are only down ~5% or less? https://imgur.com/a/atmfhEY  The Greeks don’t really support this outcome either for the calls that I’m holding.
They’re getting ready to dump it, I’m thinking...
Yeah. Honestly I sold. Might as well offset some gains at this point in the year...
Just ring the fucking bell
Up .18% today! Only need to do that 100 more time to be a millionaire
Imagine being a GOEV bag holder. Yeah that’s me.
Out of the pump and dump
FB is free money right now if you're willing to hold till earnings
[removed]
Does the tax man pay you when you go negative? Fuck this gay day.
just wondering is there any after hours today or is the market dunzo at 1pm?
🍻
Here comes XL on the reversal
SPY tryna break even on TSLA 😂
Imagine imagining
Welcome to the gang gang gang.
So we leapin' BABA right?
between that and theta they just wont stop fucking dropping. Spy been the same fucking price for a fucking month
You sure could do that. If you want to basically “put it on black” you could buy a handful of SPY 12/31 368c. If you want to be a maniac you’d put it on TSLA 660c 12/31
Oc GN with profit-taking
Cult vibes for sure. Massive echo chamber
I’m trying to get good price on baba but no make sense. Why so expensive for 5% otm
Doing lotto VXX calls because no way some crazy retard shit doesn't happen in the next two weeks
It's not eoy it's 12/24
Baba, pleas fly again.
Jusdiditthanks
i like how PDD is up bigly cuz of BABA
💸💸🙏
If aapl could hit 135 that would be great
SPY is tricky shit
right, right....but does PLTR break 30?
I almost did that exact thing yesterday, but ended up holding thru
Don’t worry GME call holders, the more shit I talk about it, the more it will go up. Anyways... GME DUMP EOD GONNA BE EPIC LOL
Its never good news when a communist country investigates you for being a monopoly. I mean, communism is basically a monopoly for government.
I’m with you dude, put in 300$ 5 mins ago
“After shaking out billions in American 🧻 🖐, the CCP proceeds to buy the fucking dip. BABA up 30%”  Thats mondays headlines
It's already failed?! This means we are now stuck with 600 right
dont miss this FCEL run about to go down!
fuck you
It feels good to be a tsla bull again
[removed]
BABA might go below 200 in the next few weeks. pretty sure the chinese govt already knew about their anti-competitive practices but they turned a blind eye.
[removed]
apple 134 EOD, 140 EOY
I was just about to ask if there was a support group
I bought in this morning @227 and am expecting to be back up at 300 within a year
Ocugen hitting $3?? Or should I get out while I’m ahead?
what's the origin of please fly again meme?
Did I pick the only lame SPAC w GOEV?  Seems like they have actual products and customers too.
218 strong support for BABA if this gets broken, we dropping.   And still the pre Xmas drop to come
XL prepping to climb again! Buy the dip while you can!
Baba will drop to 215. Easiest puts ive ever bought
This is gay
good point. i stand corrected. fuck Bitch McTurtle
&gt; worse than expected earnings   No. Earnings were better than expected.    &gt; increased store closures   Which is a basic part of the turnaround playbook. You close underperforming stores so you can focus more resources on the ones that are profitable.    &gt; Filed for a 100M shelf offering which they will surely be using soon   Why will they surely be using it soon? On the tail of share buybacks when the company has plenty of money? They won’t. It’s a poison pill to defend against RC taking over. A weak one.      I get it. You don’t actually want to know why it’s a good buy. Go back to losing money on Tesla.
If china really does pursue antitrust against them, this could just be the beginning. I personally would wait a little while. Dont see it rebounding magically any time soon
They said that when it hit 270 too
It will Melvin fucking around and being a bitch
Mods are big ga y. If you say z j z you get flagged for spam by automod. Big gay. Big if true.
same exact for me
TSLA new ath by 12!!!
How tf is BLNK outperforming SBE?
Yes
Lol @ dude calling STIC a pump and dump   am thinking he couldn’t get in under $16 and is now too cheap to get in over $18 😂😂
No stock is fundamental we are in lala land
The crash of Christmas Eve 2020 for my portfolio
Bottom on GME
Spy and most indexes are best played with 2+ month expiration and atm. Weeklies are no good
Wait till the bottom shows itself. Never a good idea to buy on a decline. It’s heading to 260
Not a good day for LAZR, VLDR or MVIS
Def. no brainer. Bought myself a bunch of July 275 calls
Gen Tso's is tendies
I took profit. It's a short day today and dont wanan be staring at my phone lol
FCEL FCEL FCEL
*WW3 gets announced*
My first day today small loss. I had to see how this thing moves.
I used to hold GME shares. I still do, but I used to too.
Lidar more like gaydar
Die FUBO hahaah best short of my life 🤑🤑🤑 Imagine saying « 100 by EOY » after a 200% runup
Yes xl's newest bag holder
Retarded. I'd buy muchhhhh further out if you are thinking about calls.
imagine falling for a coordinated WSB pump n dump
Imagine thinking you were smart for buying the BABA dip
Will my $BABA order go through for $205?
ICLN only goes up if you need a safe haven
PLTR will be stuck at $29 forever
For Christmas the market gave me an ass whooping
well ya...but im saying that the whole market is gonna suck on his dick... which is happening
free money tip buy 1/8/21 dash debit spreads
Common Christmas miracle!  TSLA 700!
😂😂😂
Is baba 1/15 240c good or do I need it to be dated farther out
Probably the spread and not a lot of volume. Look at the ask and bids.
Zoo wee momma it’s been a whole two hours
They’ve always been nice to me when I post questions and stuff. I feel like the model 3 was the turning point in the sub. everyone fighting over there is a 3 owner.
Up by eod
better just forget spy, go w aapl tsla
You trying to get BABA holders to be even more depressed? Not cool man.
Soon $TSLA will be worth more than $BABA 😄 🤣
Everyone who said 220 was the BABA bottom .. fuck you
And then you have -6% days like me today and wipe out months of your 0.18% days.
Chill out people, lots of stocks are currently selling off.  People are taking EoY profits, trimming positions,  tax write-offs, etc.  It's after days like these that stocks will have random +5% days as people jump back in at a discount
Sad this all ends in 2 hours
I literally fuckinf hate sitting in Amazon calls while they die alll fucking day
I haven’t made any calls or puts on tesla but why on earth is It up
Can I stop Robinhood from auto selling?
where do you think TSLA is gonna end today?
Once all the soccer moms started getting Teslas, it was just downhill from there.
Ez tendies
I don’t think there is ever a wrong time to buy PTON
I think it’ll struggle with 30 for a week or two before breaking out. I’ve been writing covered calls and am looking to stop when it starts testing 30.
YEARS?! RIP Callholders
Out with a 500% gain on my 0DTE 645c’s. Merry Christmas Elon!
Spacs are the closest thing to free money there is in life
I just sold, gl bros
Dump PLTR
People been saying it's at the top since $7
Might’ve followed pleas fly again guy into PINS. 🤦🏽‍♂️    12/31 72C
Grab them if you are retarded, this is classic power struggle and will fall even lower when they announce the falsified charges when backroom talks breakdown again. BAT has nothing to fear because they already offload all their assets to oversea shell capitals, CCP has nothing to lose neither since they will keep fucking them until they take back control.  Buy the dip yes, but this is not it yet.
MM’s been raking it in for months with theta
Get on SPWR while you still can 🚀
People were calling me dumb by selling at $55 this sub is retarted
AAPL is up about $1.50 since open...BRK.B is up about $1.50 since open...
AAPL and TSM saving my portfolio today. Who woulda thunk it
1:00 🤣
C3.ai (AI) about to complete its kast baby step for rocket launch, nothin but the moon from here boys
Same.
Wheres the Tim 🍏 fanboy??  He usually says sthg like  ‘TIM TIM TIM TIM TIM 🗣 TIM 🍏’
A rocket didn’t launch and someone asked for the company to fly again. Virgin galactic I think
Absolutely violated by Christopher Robin’s gang of woodland characters.. fuck you BABA, I loved you!
Come on pltr
Yeah with a EPS of 9.31 and a PE of 23 for a tech stock, its super overvalued. Ill get in at ipo price
SENS 🚀
FUBO has ben good to me (rode it up from $25 to $60)      Time to go back in again
Please ban this idiot
What’s a good ticker to look into? PLTR is shit QS about to pop and THCB has no calls. Any suggestions guys?
Is LULU a good buy right now ?
NET IS UNSTOPPABLE
I don't know what's holding it back. But once FCELL breaks free it's going RIP UP MaSSIVELY 🚀🚀🚀
That's why iI'm not rolling my 12/31 calls just yet. Technicals are set up nice, the shorts don't have enough to keep a big rally down. I hope we finish above 21 even though shorts are trying desperately to keep it below 21
STIC 🚀🚀🚀🤡🤡
go back to /r/stocks
Also wondering this
I got burned lmao
Have enough liquidity to exercise at close
I bet the Gynese top officials already got out beforehand
Have enough money to buy all the stock of the contracts your holding.
GO🍆EV is going really fucking down
AAPL said they’re going to be the next TSLA this week and you sleepy fucks really sat there and thought Plant Shit-Tier and a Game Just-Stop are the winning moves.
SPY 370 eod. No doubt
RKT is a $10b company
[removed]
PTON is not a bike company. It is a rocket ship.  New ATH
Farther and I’d wait for it to dip more
Fuck yes SOLO keep ripping
To much  n o i s e  in here today
Wtf is PLTR
190 imo and it stays there for a year
2 hours left AAAAHHHHHH
Nononono. I'm not a doomsgayer.
It’s been red for five days
Red christmas 🎄
Should I hold FUBO or become a 🏳️‍🌈🐻
Etrade is fucking impossible to get in touch with wtf
looks like ~20.60 is GME's new floor?
My calls sure hope so
God speed brother. Right there with you.
BABA puts are up 15000%
Check volume and the bid/ask spread
Thinking of loading the boat on BABA shares at this level. $220 is more than 30% off ATH.
And miss out the weekly monday skyrocket after Friday dump? No thanks
Not I. Just bought my first most expensive naked call 220c June 2022. Usually a spread guy, for days like these.
Always teasing us. Common already PLTR!
Go long.  30PT.  Merger just completed this week, normal for SPACS to drop after merger. If you have weeklies, roll out and 🚀🖐🏻
Just a big green dido for aapl
In all of them and might as well go back to sleep
TSLA nooooo. Pleas come back
1000
Santa rally? Where is it?
Anyone playing WKHS today? Got 12/31 25c I’m just unsure about
We all know this is really because jack ma kept doing those Michael Jackson performances
That’s right hahahahah
😎
Probably profit taking. It might take a day or so to straighten out and refuel
I hope you die
Santa gang 🎄🎅
Conflicted to go with spy calls or puts. Calls because stimulus spending bill, but puts because Republicans are doing retard level shut. But calls because free money, but puts because Donnie may throw this shit in the shredder. Wtf......
Been holding NVDA for 3 months and it hasn’t fucking moved, could have put that money in PLTR :(
Come on ARKK
🥺
[removed]
who gonna leave money on xmas table ?
real products = bearish
NGL - starting to lose faith
The most coy stock
Bruh. I have about 25k in between calls and warrants riding on the GOEV.  Don't know how much longer until I dump this pos and keep it moving.
dissapointing
tired of watching pltr like this, i’ll be back in january. merry christmas ya filthy animalz
Fuck him in his ugly ass
I grabbed some $140c jan 2023 calls
Buy and hold long it will come back
Just because something is being pumped doesnt make it a pump and dump.
Why is ROKU toying with my emotions?!??
Yup. Right before it hits 125 EOD.
yoloed my remaining $186 on TSLA 690 calls. What are the chances it goes in the money?
Recommend your favorite autobiography? Finishing Elon's and need something next.  *Position: RIOT leaps and selling weekly CCs against it"
Good boy go get the STICk
You think this investigation lasts less than a month?
https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kccpoi/found_this_on_twitter_how_fucked_is_he/
fuck SRNE why..
There were plenty of comments about lockup ending this week. Lots of people didn't know what that meant I guess?
switch to ToS, best customer service I've experienced in any industry
Just saying CCP prolly didn’t think that BABA gonna plunge with the antitrust investigation news cuz they didn’t see big drops from US scompanies when they announced the same thing. This means BABA gonna be bought at the dip and recover back to 250
a tweet after the virgin galactic launch fail
$XMAS calls
Maybe in the long run
its Christmas
RKT makes money on mortgages. Mortgages are at all time highs.
Fuck I wish I could short STIC
Is there any us broker that will let me buy lvmh? Lines at sephora are huge. Busiest store at the malls right now.
[removed]
Another day, another Amazon flat day
[removed]
BABA is like one of those tv commercials for boomers where they keep on dropping the price every 30 seconds to get you to buy now
Out of daytrades for the week. Any suggestions for holdings for the long weekend?
STIC causing some serious FOMO
You get reimbursement but not payment, that assumes you gained. Which is obvious you are retarded
none
Juicy dip on JMIA, hmmmmmm
See you Monday bro
Where did you buy? We will see it come back next week.
I'd play Jan 22 expiry. You get the tail risk of 🥭 fucking with transition too
Welp- I sold BLNK too early. Sold 400x shares at 2.91 and closes Jan $10C in November… FML
So many fomo’d into GME are now mad it’s not popping. It DID pop. Now you have to be patient for the next one.
Fuck man I need a rally on nio jeezuss
Well yeah, you believed the iCar was a thing? I hope you’re not holding the Lidar companies that rode along.
Post the loss
Guy in the TSLA forum on why engineers should work today and tomorrow to get the holiday update rolled out:  “I'm sure it will be as much as a present to them to see their passionate work in the hands of users and see their happy faces on reddit.”  Lmfaoo
Really good dip in FEYE, cyber security stock will be like green energy stock next year
Merry Christmas TSLA short sellers! Here is a bigger asshole for more dicks!
And you know who will fly past them after merger??? GH👁V
Another week, another shredded blue-collar paycheck. I see what I’m doing, I understand what I’m doing is stupid, and still...
BABA HOLDERS HAVE GONE EXTINCT
Bahahaha stupid bag holder
IPOF $15C for March exp
Santa rally feels more like a Santa crash
Never try and catch a falling knife.
wtf power hour starts in an hour??
That won't go over well with the shareholders who bought at 40b mkt cap
actually pretty possible
Its cause ur dumb
Wow, I am getting raped on NVIS
[removed]
PLTR trending like a scam stock about to get delisted by New Years. Dump that SHITSTAIN of a stock and put your money into VALUE stocks bros. Heed my warning....
Back in the USSR⛏
Jeeeeezus,,,, at this price I'm actually considering grabbing more BABA
Obama
Wrong
Puts never ever ever work
BABA 220 and 225 strike price today are swining 50% every 2 mins.
What’s a good call to buy? I have $435 left to use today
I hope. I’m new to options and my luck has been shit this far
Buy NIO they said
Wake up, Cathie
I know that’s what I have now and am comparing it with. They are really amazing.  Not trying to switch over, was just curious about different platforms so went and opened a few little play accounts
Ofc TSM up after I stopped playing last week
$MS bounced off vwap if anyone cares.
people are dumbfuck assholes (see also: dolan trump elected president).  more people are buying Teslas  more people = more assholes. QED.
BLNK
Nice NIO dip there
Now I'm glad I found other bag holders.   Thought I was the only dumbass drowning out here.
It’s going to launch.
I just wanted a quick pump to $25 :(
Give me a good call to buy I have $435 left
[removed]
This isn’t very Merry
I’ve been trying to contact them for weeks
Let Tesla fly!!!
Imagine selling TSLA before $700 😆
I don't know if they care about that. It's more about keeping anyone from having too much power over there.
Red days are illegal for PLUG
Palantir dipped, buy now, and sell 29 cents higher for big money 🤑
Imagine buying FSLY calls on the dip expecting a nice bounce
I don’t understand... but that’s ok more tendies for us 🤑🤑🤑
Who did this? lol
RIP Canoo
This is the answer. But yeah I’m stunned that people aren’t hopping all over it.. this is easy double bagger by Jan.
Guys, genuine question. I got some tesla debit spreads 640/645 exp jan. 29. I bought them when tesla was $622, on december 22. Now this spreads change from positive to negative 50 percent every second. Should I just leave them to expire or try to sell it? And shouldn't it be always green anyway? Thanks!
I think I need that stimulus check more than ever now
I just need BABA at 225...
After dropping down to $17/share today I think we’re fucked. At this point I’m just hoping it goes back up a little so my losses aren’t as bad.
Just be Chinese LMAO, but if are really interested  https://asia.nikkei.com/Editor-s-Picks/China-up-close/Analysis-Xi-sees-Alibaba-and-Tencent-as-rising-threats-to-power  https://asia.nikkei.com/Editor-s-Picks/China-up-close/Analysis-Xi-s-message-to-Jack-Ma-You-re-nothing-but-a-cloud  https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-president-xi-jinping-halted-jack-ma-ant-ipo-11605203556  Ma got the taste of ultimate power, going back to being a nobody is a no even with money.
spy its Christmas, you were supposed to do a 5% face ripper today
PLTR. Give me my money back. PLTR, do you hear me? I want my money back. Give me my fucking money back, you motherfucker.
get on in united wholesale
He is being satcastic
Not trading today I don’t wanna get crushed before 1pm and lose money before christmas
expiry?
Mitch holding long
lots of calls coming in for SNOW now. finishing at 330-332 today
Time to close Robinhood
Shorts sold 800k shares of FCEL today. Anyone want to go on a bear hunt? Buy calls
It’s ok. TSLA just reloading. 💎🖐💎🖐
Baba 2021 January 220c's are like 1100... shit what to do
Fuck crm jesus
Isn’t there a NIO investor day next month
"And now we'll throw in an extra -5%, yours absolutely free!"
🙋🏽‍♂️
FCEL.. can’t stress it enough
FEYE with the Megagay smh.
you have less patience than my 6 year old. it's been consolidating and trending upwards for like 3 weeks, chill haha
And if you order in the next minute, they’ll throw in a free $BIDU with your purchase.
Seems like the damn alibaba thing is spilling into other Chinese stocks.
Since when does China give a shit about monopolies? These retards fell out of line and have to be put in their place, that is all..
Except RIOT is only monthly options
GME not moving 😢
This is not how this was supposed to go
BABA up 2% on the year 😂
baba is going to crater from 1200-1300 today
STIC
We got a portfolio to burn
buy BABA 210$ puts? or sell what’s the difference
CCP gonna buy back shares slowly over time. They do care cuz it is a money maker. Just saying.
Can someone tell me the meat on FCEL looks like it’s in a fat dip should I hop in?
You know they aren’t actually selling anything until 2022 right?  That said, I was in early and will be holding long term I love their products and business model and so does their partner Hyundai.
It’s a longer term hold but we’re setting up for a nice lift off if we can break 30-31
Daddy needs stimmy to make some degenerate calls
No. Next real bottom is $16-$17. Then we'll ride to $25. Rinse and repeat, new higher lows until March. Buy the dips, sell the rips
Down a cool 6k today. Merry Christmas to me
red day
Only if you owned TSLA.
That’s why I ain’t trading today lol
Just checked Iborrowdesk. Shorts are trying to short it hard
How much more can BLNK really rip?
gj you bought high
You into music? A lot of good ones from rock and roll artists from the 60s and 70s. Loved Claptons and Gregg Allman's  but there are plenty of other good ones as well
Their earnings were literally worse than expected lol.  The primary problem is that they offered literally nothing as to why the hell anybody would go there over: Amazon, Target, Walmart.   I'm actually making a fair chunk of change on TSLA IV crush right now though so that's working out. Banks printed this week as well.
Arnold Schwarzenegger’s is pretty good.
are we still buying MVIS.  would like to add this to my list of meme stocks
Sold my 0DTE TSLA calls... didn’t to but that dip just now wiped out half my profits ($10,000) instantly 😭
They don't until they do. I made 8.5k on June 10-11 when the spy dropped 6% I made 2.5k a month ago when spy gapped up over no news. Or the usual news of stimmy going well
How the fuck is SOLO green and GOEV -1.58?
That happened to me after September. Had so many small but good green days then boom -10% in 3 days
Look how they massacred my boy baba
This is the best GME dip were getting.  Don't fuck it up because it's a short day.
Fucking XL what the fuck
What is McConnells vendetta with weed? Personal issues, or some other influence?
Nice!! Learning every day dude will help you so much in the long game for big tendies
I hope bears are eating cause there better be no complaints if we green next week
Selling volume is off the chart but price goes up. How is that possible?
BABA triple bottom
Cathy woods bought baba before this. She is retarded
Plug is going to go off.
Glad I dumped that shit stain of a stock that is PLTR
Panic buy
Pleas dump so we can fly again
I do think there is a play here. They can't just liquidate it overnight. Might be some bleeding until the new year and then a rebound play
Fuck bro. I’d say GME, that thang is moving. I’m not invested though.
I was doing good last week, took losses this one for being impacient trying to “day trade”. Never again, only betting on “sure” things from now on
BUY THIS NVTA DIP
Last 30mins of trading day fren.
join the not valued at 3200 with no split in sight gang.
Should I hold these XL bags till Monday?
Fuck this CRM lol, I will move to meme stocks again now
Do you think it will continue?  I planned to trim this week so I closed all short term positions but some of my leaps getting shanked hard
The market reminds me of that one time I was fucking this girl reverse cow girl and it felt like my dick broke. She said “other guys like it when I do it this way.” Other guys like their dicks being broken?
Well when Santa is high on cocaine driving the train to 375 he kinda forget about Christmas and to bring the rally with em
Vldr ran up 50% mon/tues. anyone that bought after that had it coming.
Done with options, SPAC’s only
Whichever one of you said in premarket yesterday "buy the MVIS dip, you can send me a tip later". Heres a tip, you are a fucking retard.
GameStop needs to announce their EV
Come on Elon 700 eod pls 🥲
Wow, what a week. This Santa rally has been great. 😩💦
Fuckin a man
Someone smart give me a end of year yolo.
PlTr ShoRtS TsLa
Oh man this comment is gold. You belong here
I’ve constantly lost 1300 every day this week so far
I am so sick of Amazon’s bullshit
Yeah, not very cash money at all... 😒
BABA just wants to get back home to China so it's gotta keep drilling
Nah I’m totally fine throwing it out as a gamble. That’s why I’m here lol
lol at people getting suckered into that STIC pump
No.
Same legit fuck this stock
Amzn options are retarded why am I in there
I'm 2 months out on my ARKK calls, so I'm not worried. Just need 2 solid weeks from her and I'll eat plenty good.
Fuck me I bought $23 0DTE feye puts at .14 and solder .33 this morning... now they’re worth 100 a piece
Broooo
given the year thats shockingly good.
I'm not touching spacs over $11. There's still plenty out there 9-10.50 range awaiting their turn
All I want for Xmas is a five figure day. Come on 🥭 sign the stimmy
Doesn't BLNK look really overbought right now?
PLTR so stupid volatile jfc
because he's a hedge fund intern being paid to foment negative sentiment so his bosses don't get fucked
I have been promised a squeeze.
ARKK drops, ARKK leaps go up.  MMs just don’t want me to get in. 😭😭
Smol pp n r g.
PSTH.
If you still haven’t learned your lesson with these Chinese stocks you kind of deserve it
If SPY really dumps right after I sell my 368Ps for a huge loss I’m going to lose my mind
GME
It was supposed to be a white Christmas but now, just brown and sad.
You know it’s bad when ARK and is red
BLNK in dis bitch
Upvote if we should stand back &amp; stand by on buying the BABA dip
Debit spreads can be priced fuckily until you get closer to expiration.  It should be at max gain, and will be very green, but you won’t see all of that until you’re closer to expiration.
That fucker is dying in its $220 hill.  -20% by end of day.
I got Jan 15s close enough for the news cycle to start buzzing about it alreast
All these paper handed bitches gonna help us fly 🚀🛸
Are we expecting a sell off at close again ?
Why does XL keep dropping?
Yeah I thought that as I typed it lmao
[removed]
I bought just cuz of meme potential. Not expecting it to pop off tho
He prefers cocaine
How is shorting a stock not manipulation ? You “borrow” a couple million shares and then dump them flooding the que and then driving the price down?   Am I missing something here?
Not yet, spent all morning panic buying
BABA 240C for March guaranteed $$$?
Baba taking a massive dump
You and me both. Bleeding here
SPWR FLYINGGGGGG
SPAC are free money rn like it or not
Buying the BABA dip  Hopefully China's actions aren't too harsh.
that's a weird expiry with lower volume calls atm. So every time orders flow your brokerage will get weird with what they show as your net liquidating value. Check the bid-ask on those strikes, it's probably wide as fuck
Anyone holding through the long holiday weekend?
No lol
Let's destroy investor confidence in our companies so we can fuck over one person in particular. That'll show him 🤡
Triple pay and I’m in!
360P SPY
Yes but still need to be careful about buy in price
Yo I have a 700c expiring today 😂
I’m just going to say it now before it’s spammed in 2/3 weeks $F👀👀👀
He's probally got a ton of doners vested in anit Marijuana
They really made a Brexit deal?
BLNK had quite a pop. Puts on BLNK?
I don’t see BABA getting much lower than this
HAHAHA join the club, I was done with it yesterday
https://twitter.com/RocketManGuyMan/status/1340741894184161280?s=09
CRWD killing me
Short wankers
I thought XL was the chosen one.
I doubt bleeding. I think it will recover slowly. It’s around the support line too.. I mean if it breaks down it’s done tho..
Already in
u must not understand how she trades. she will be double down until this shit hits the bottom.
I'd like to know!
BABA $230c 12/31
Everybody FOMO into AMD so my calls and shares can print 😔
Sir, this is a casino.
PLTR drained my entire account 😔
It do be like that
Absolutely
Nooooooo
LAme
Yes but idk what day I 3rd week of Jan but don't quote me on that
Yoloing my Christmas bonus on gme 0days.  My kids already got gifts on top of already having everything they can ever want.  Can Santa deliver for me?  I'd like more than a new pair of pj's this year.
It had a short report on it, so it's getting murdered.   If this stock is like any other that's had a hit piece out on it, it's going to rebound shortly. I doubled my position for the rebound.
Yeah that position isn’t for me. If she doesn’t know how to do it right and leans forward too much it just hurts.
Cathie will load up on BABA today
oh you'll get it back, probably not what you put in though
I’m with you.
Suck my yule log Xi!  😡
Amzn and aapl pod racing rn
why are people buying BLNK when SBE (chargepoint) will be so much better after the SPAC merger
you would short a meme stock?
GME seems risky getting in now, I’ve been fucked by it before
Looks like MMs are finally cashing out to buy their hookers coke for Christmas
anyone else still looking at rolls royce?  i feel like this is bottom, but who knows.
Today but look at their charts over the last week!
Tesla puts, right now, are free money.  That's my Christmas gift to you all.  Merry Christmas 🎄🎄🎄
BABA gonna slowly bleed to $200 hol li shyt
Bought the FCEL dip. Now i wait for the Santa Clause Rally 🙏🏻🚀🚀🚀
So why did baba die again?
Just when u think boom 🤯 210
fax we recover by 1pm guarantee
GME is a boomer stock now
No
SPY 370C 12/28   Monday’s always green and everyone gonna be literally itching to trade in their new Xmas jammies
Options on SPACs is the best money
32$
Any plays for $300 I need a winnnn
But thanks homie. Merry Christmas! (If that’s your thing)
We’re all going to have to come to terms with the fact that BLNK will eventually get to 182.
Rips up close to 100%, fine.   -10% ???
What if I have calls though
My boy DONKEYKONG down for the count. Rip
How damn why is santa giving me coal for Christmas? Fucking market implosion wtf
go to dollar store, buy toy gun and balaclava, rob someone.
Sounds like a plan. Good luck
Hahahahha some of you thought BB would reach 7.5, fuck that guy
Damn, looks like my Christmas gift is gonna be some kneepads for the parking lot behind the Wendy’s
I hate how Robinhood calculates option value in a way that says the contract I just paid $22 for is only $20 so I lost 10% instantly even though you can't actually get it for $20 and I actually already paid less than the last sale before me
Let me invest in GYNA when I have because I’m smarter than the USA companies 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
China is going to organ harvest Jack Ma and take his big head
Noooooooooo
No. Earnings were better than expected. If you can’t get a basic fact like that right, you’re not worth talking to.    https://m.benzinga.com/article/18703384
Bruh Baba is extinct. What the hell.
Fuck everything
It went 90% and you’re like wHy DoEs iT KeEp DroOopINg
Maybe who knows. No one can predict future.
Wrong way elon
But my quant, Yang, is all over it.
An anatomically incorrect position
Already really high at the moment.
I’m converting my 401k to be all SPACs. It’s literally if free money and can’t go tits up.
As of this writing TSLA is worth more than BABA. lmao.  The amazon of China is worth less than TSLA. crazy times!
it was just up 25% and now theres no news its cooling off
Pretty boring day tbh bout to log off and go do some last minute shopping. How tf is it already 11:00?
Dipping now, how low will it go?
Pltr guh
Sorry to hear that. I would say if you are willing to average down that can be a good idea. Otherwise just wait a few weeks to see how things go. After all, it's only a loss if you sell at a loss
I hope you get coal coated in dog shit
But it’s going up...
Markets just a punching bag today huh
This day turning big gay
Please Jack, do something. I’ve been loyal to you since 30 mins ago. Don’t let me down.
SOLO on the next dip
Products and revenue are bearish
I think it's because the pump yesterday was from an updated price target and not anything tangible.
Expiration is weeks from now. Don't be weak.
From 490 to the 3.2k back to 500 it’s been a fun month.. at most I pulled out 650 gonna take this last 500 to Vegas 🤙🤙🤙 see you when the stimmy hits and PLTR is 35 mid jan
Managing to escape margin call by the skin of my teeth today.
"Trade in your old car for a $11 credit!"
What is **LUV**?    **BABA** don't hurt me   Don't hurt me   **NIO** more
If 660 falls I'll paper hand this bitch
Baba
Should I buy the SQ dip? Think it's down due to the rumors of SQ buying Tidal, but that seems like such a stupid decision, there's no way they're serious
Tesla shareholders will never sell that stock. Godamn I should probably but it
Baby girl Cathie 🥺
scrooge has come for the turkey
MM think of the children!!!
Prepare your assholes, this is gonna hurt
Bro I had 34c 12/31 and sold it at 1.19 it’s now 19.50
Just bout tsla 12/31 670c, am I stupid ?
I’m holding 12/31 as well. Good luck. I agreed. I’d double down if I could.
Anyone bagholding FUBO? I completely missed the 60 boat after I dozed off and now paying the god damn price.
Oil stocks and QQQ practically have an inverse relationship, so if you want to short tech, long oil
Guys..  *laughs* this isn’t difficult here BATTERY PLAYS ARE THE ANSWER FOR JANUARY..   FCEL  PLUG &amp;the others that are down today   Guys, **BATTERY SHOWCASE** Is In January.. the run up alone will push FCEL above 15-20 range. No brainer easy Scrooge mcduck money bags heading your way for anyone who hops in before the boom next week
Sorry to whoever saw my FSR and PLUG comment a few minutes ago and bought in
It’s culling day bois   holding your calls til eow will fuck you
Spelling has never been my favorite😪
SURF $12.5C February
IGAC NEW SPAC GET IN HERE 10.3
BABA makes me so fucking pissed. Every time I say it can’t get lower it does.
Merry Christmas, I guess
FUBO calls at close for that dead cat? Am i crazy?
I’m thinking about it. How low is the dip going to go?
I got in yesterday before close and out this AM
Pleas fly again
dammit PLTR, find the floor
I have both and NBAC
Right. Support is at $210 and then at $200.
What’s the next play? Boxing Day sales? Amazon calls?
God damn it PLTR y u do dis
I just look at what PLTR does every day, shake my head and laugh like a lunatic.
There’s a retard filter at the entrance. Only lets retards in.
Timed the top perfectly on TSLA. Hoping it dips some more so I can buy back in.
That’s banking on something insane happening I stopped buying puts election week when we almost had a civil war and the market rallied 🤡
I see this as a win, boomers never sell
amd or sne are guaranteed and pretty safe gains cause of their upcoming ER
Willing to go all in at baba 150
All my coworker talks to me about is stocks and honestly it’s fucking annoying people start trading and it becomes their personality trait
Thats what I assumed with having far ITM debit spreads but just wanted to make sure. Thanks!
Just fucking bleed and hit bottom already. BABA dragging my boy NIO down for no good reason at all.
I can't possible predict, but if you were confident enough to buy a leap, and you had a decent entry on it, then don't worry   Close your app, walk away, enjoy the Xmas week my dude, don't get caught up in the manic WSB energy, most of the people screaming here have OTM weeklies
3 though...
🤡
Ford? Just say it bro we are modless now
+1 for creativity
His dick is probably and innie
Buy $300 worth of books on being a man
I bet she gobbles up a bunch more the. All the losers here see she did and fomo when it’s 80% recovered
I’d accept “in-kind” stimulus from AOC, if you know what I mean 😏👌
Aaaaaaand here we fucking go again  Can’t have shit in Detroit
If apple doesn’t drop $2 I’m done. If it does drop I’m gonna have a lot of money. Merry Christmas everyone
Done holding CRM fuck that shit
Sitting on 3k shares @ $1.7 probably consolidate at 3$
It fought on that $220 hill and that's where it died.  I'm predicting -20% by end of day.
Was literally the perfect theta play 😫
I already paperhanded mine for a small loss
Not at this rate seems like it’s already happened
Just closed out my covered calls on mvis holding shares very happy. This is going to continue to leg up over the course of the days, get in now guys prime oppurtunity
Rally time. Bought the dip
i want it to $25 then ill buy more
How far out GME calls?
I sold it for gme but it'll be back to Tesla when I'm done using gme
christmas is cancel
BABA and SQ better fucking be green next week. Merry Christmas retards.
Wtf happened to it? Got wrecked
Just another day of PLTR bleeding me dry.  I hate this POS
Lmao i remember when people in here called 280 the bottom on BABA...what a journey
God that wood gives me wood sheesh 😓
Buy the palantir dip!
Bruh you don't buy puts when it's going down. That's FOMO, and that's bad trading.  Listen to me or don't, I don't care. It's just a gift.
So sorry bud. EV is a tough market. I mean, really tough. Everything is jumping in now as all tech is maxed out.   Were you looking short or long hold?
Doesn't matter, morons across the world will still continue to invest in China while they do whatever the fuck they want. Chinese leaders are complete P.O.S.', I'm surprised people haven't figured this out yet.
Someone please stop BABA
Not the end yet. Dump b4 Xmas coming. 210 may happen
QS just grow already
What happened?
I’d wish you good luck but I’m rooting for NKLA to hit $0 where it belongs, so bad luck
Happy Holidays everyone. Its been a hell of a year on this sub and wish nothing but the best for you all, in and out of your trades.
Upvote for cutting losses downvote for diamond hands
Because Ma is playing with fire and about to mysteriously disappear or something.
Damn I am a paperhands bitch today. I sold my NET calls I bought yesterday for 30% profit when it hit 85.50 this morning...
Santa wtf is this
When is my stimi check hitting my bank account
Same people who are calling PLTR a scam stock and shit were also laughing at GME after earnings by the way. Imagine getting baited into selling by them.
I fomo’ din not sure if I should sell or will actually run higher
Limp Weener Energy all week 😑
This market 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
Just look at all the hosts at cnbc
we all know Cathie buyin the fk outta BABA right now
should've exited CRSR when i had the chance now this shit is going back to 30 again
She can seize my means of production.
Baba come on this is a bit exaggerated
Cannabis being illegal was the easiest way to put black people in jail and McConnell comes a line of confederates.
Bid and ask  + place limit order for the bid price  + wait for the dip  + bid price will always be lower than the average price
Literally just fuck these random quick sell offs man so frustrating
I have mostly leaps but threw in a few of those same 12/31s, fingers crossed for a christmas miracle next week!
Just so you know, snowflakes will fall across your RH app on Xmas day.  Just like our memefolios
at least April - you want to capture the Q4 earnings date and shareholder meeting in your window
Isn’t the vote Monday .?

STOP THE COUNT
Lol he must be making money and you ain’t 😂
MM pulling the rug profit taking ...buy the dip it’s coming fast
[removed]
So is BABA trying to set a record? All the way to zero today?
Guh
I just bought BABA 1/15/21 165c and I’m a mega autust. So this might just be retarded enough to print
Holy shit, baba just keeps going lower
210 is fine. If that’s the downside
Anyone bearish on zoom
Random massive red candle
Don’t markets always go red on Christmas???
I’m gonna double down on this dip for my 1/15 VALE calls 🚀🚀🚀
Jk I don’t spam. I just have most my moneys in AAPL lmao
NET and GRWG saving me from a red day
We’re all just looking for confirmation bias
Xmas sell off? :(((
Holy fuck that baba rug pull
Got in on the little dip now. 2/19/21 $105c
He’s not he’s a rested like me
This is the lowest pltr will be in the next 3 months. Don't lose faith
They do the same thing in my experience— lose you money.
WTF   V U Z I?!
Lost 75% of my account in one week :)
PUTS on BABA until $0
At this rate BABA gonna drill all the way back to GYNA
Well don't look now
You too man, lets hope our diamond hands will be rewarded
baba 300 june leaps?
AAPL partnering with NIO for ev car?!!!
No it’s down because the whole market is sucking dick right now
BABA there goes that man
Much love to nwbo today.

Great bouncing icebergs!
LEAPs on BABA soon?
microvision? Don't they have a $1.50 pt?
Is amzn even in business anymore?
Yep
CCP is the black swan
Not sure if STICk in the mud or if it’ll actually run up
Merry Christmas bro nice gains!
It's finally COSTs time to shine. $400 by end of Jan no problem
FCEL primes for a nice rally any minute now 🚀🚀🚀
My portfolio went to a sea of red with a few green islands in the last 20 mins
Next week and January is about to be straight fuckin green after today’s bullshit
In detroit?
I did that but the dip wasn't coming so I went closer to the ask to actually get the trade to execute
How is buying a stock not manipulation? You "borrow" a couple million dollars and then flood the queue with market orders, driving the price up?
Hoping PLTR ends at $28, just to see if the CC I sold get exercised.
All of a sudden China cares about ethics. Communist fucks
This is stolen lol
Honey! Fetch me my bathing toaster!
CAN SPY JUST HIT 369 PLS THANK YOU
Why not
Baba omg
Merry Christmas to you too!!!
wow i'm absolutely not having a good day
I thoght BABA might end up 220, this is looking like it will end up 210
Worst Christmas Eve ever.
Crazy how immune I get to market L’s
Xi doesn't like Jack Ma
Carti is dropping Whole Lotta Red on Christmas... is this a sign?!
US antitrust stocks -&lt;2% China antitrust -15% people are dumb 🤣
Stop saying it cant go lower.
PLTR has some issues but GME actually had an absolutely atrocious earnings call lol  PLTR has money issues but some cool tech and government contracts
Did you buy puts? This is December not March.
$NET $$$
He’s not he tells me everything we’re both retarded
DKNG calls on every dip, im going down with this ship
Buying puts that is.
PLTR you can still make me cum comeon
Its a country
Let’s get this 🍞🍞🍞🍞
Fuck GYNA and all those idiots in that shithole
Same 😭😭😭
Cathie taking the day off to be with her family... fucking bitch
That ARK cliff 👀
Baba found the noose and hung itself
GME and my Covered calls on other tickers are the only thing green right now.  🤡
Best investment you can for 2021 will be guns and ammunition, I ain’t talking about the stonks
Well at least today ends early so I don't have to watch the bloodbath all day 😂😥
This is a huge overreaction for BABA
holy rug pull
It will certainly be $25-30 by merger, but weather or not today ends above $18 is the question. #OpportunityCost
imagine having access to the most in-demand growth investments in the world from your toilet seat but instead choosing to put your money in some shithole commie stock
So no one knows why BLNK is up? 😏😏😏
SPX 3700 for Xmas
i always think i just fucked up bad, then i come read this thread
Honestly for cloudflare just wait for another inevitable dip day. There will almost definitely be one next week
Sir, this is a methadone clinic.
Who the fuck is selling BABA?? Buncha retards, institutional investors see value at this price point. Paper handed fucks
Half of this sub is shilling a ticker  Half of this sub is buying that ticker  Half of this sub is the MM algos finding the dumbest plays they call sell  Half of this sub is people who started trading in April and think it's the easiest thing ever  Half of this sub can't do fractions or any sort of math without a $ in front  And 300% of the posts are about GME, PLTR, or both
Monopoly investigation
😬
Cathie wood is the new buffett, don’t even try to change my mind
Lmao
CNBC pumping Apple and saying Intel is dead.
Is it me or does it feel like the market is struggling to stay at this level. What takes us past 370 again?
Well only lost 75% on BABA better than 99% I guess. Done with Chinese stocks forever. Those commie fucks are only interested in keeping power at all costs.
It is actually wide as fuck, wow. 0.20-5$, changes every second
Facts. It’s actually easier to control a few large companies vs a bunch of smaller ones anyways.
US or China
Imagine catching a falling knife like BABA
Today is green....
Yeah but I’m retardier
Yeah man I just got mugged by this fucking 6’6” Motherfucker in a red candle suit walking home from my job in Detroit. Fucking bullshit man
Yea.. Maybe the best play is not getting in at all..
Baba to zero!
You buy at the top?
When did this sub become a bunch of 📄 🤚 bitches.  Hold the fucking line

Market close please wtf is this
I feel like everything I watch is down, how are markets still green lol
Looks like it’s about to change ticker symbols by acquiring Bark Box next week.
They just got 15 different patents on Lidar tech and are getting attention my Large tech companies
Santa rally canceled, go drink egg nog now
I see PLTR is going to stick around $28 till everyone’s poor then will moon as is the way
Time to take the loss on my LMT leaps or what?
Can't think of more appropriate Christmas gift for **2020** than my portfolio being wiped out. Fuck you
Mixed bag of calls, mostly fucked
3 months out tho
BABA is a great company and relatively undervalued. The problem is Pooh Bear is trying to kill it.
How the fuk some idiots think that tech can be moved out of Bay Area? It’s going to take 1 aweful hurricane to bring Musk and Karp to their senses before they crawl right back to CA
Incoming world government
Pffffff
Haha zoom out....
ARKK runs 30% on a month, dips &lt;1%   People: ABOOOORTTTTT SELLLLLL ITS THE END OF YINES
Pass on crazy eyes.
TSLA is bears worst nightmare  TSLA short seller, writing calls lost 200B this year.  which is like half of TSLA market caps
God damn where the fuck is the bottom on BABA...
AMD is starting to take off must be rotation from baba into anything else
Fuck yes but not yet she is controlled by shorts
Where's all the money going today
how do u like the view from the top?
RemindMe! 1 week
TSLA is the market now
Ma fucked with xi. In return xi fucked ma
I'm going balls deep on BABA calls jesus take the wheel
yup that'll do it  hope it matures to full profit cause it's gonna be hard to sell lol
If you’re selling right now you’re the ultimate paper handed bitch and you’ll understand that after Xmas when you realize you sold at the new low for the whole year lmfao
ALL ARK ETF’S RED!
Looks like I get red for Christmas
They saw Trump pretend to care about $2000 stimulus checks and had to one up him.  Putin will give Crimea back any day now, as not to be out done of course.
Wtf happened today? I had gains in the morning and now mostly red. I slept in 😔
bought the BABA dip and it kept DIPPING
What’s your plan with the last $25?
It's a low volume day? It's fine.
Well damn what just happened to MVIS, I just doubled up on the dip though.
Yea we don’t know
MM stole my Christmas.
AMD is always 3 days late to a pump
So I made good $$$ back in Feb and March - told my dad about it at the time and he was so proud. Since then I have lost all of it and went very negative overall. Of course my dad asks me about it today and I tell him. Never seen my dad so disappointed and sad 😞
Hurricanes affect the gulf not Austin.
OK, bought
ok got rid of qqqj dead weight and got some ghi.v feb calls
Yikesss that's gotta sting - I had BABA puts this morning that I sold for 2, those are now over 4.50 and I'm kicking myself for playing too safe
China can actually decide to just shut down a company though
lmao
I know baba is getting spanked but people from wsb were actually in baba? I literally havent heard anything about them for the last few months. Everybody has been in pltr, tsla, gme, ark, nio, etc.
Wake me up when there's a v
What a fitting Christmas Eve session. Fuck this year
THANKS FOR PLAYING. SEE YOU NEXT TIME  👑🐌👑
NKLA down 85+% from ATH. Let’s get this turd to 99%.
I think we're going to see a solution to their money issues next quarter.
U made money u did good
PLTR pleas fly again
Should I pick up more AMC calls?
Buy this dip on XL? 🤔
🗣️📢SUUU BAEE  SU👏SU👏  SU👏SU👏SU👏
I obviously know the answer but to help the other retards here... is it bad idea to buy short otm calls today, jan 15, that you’re swinging for Monday because theta over the long weekend?
BABA is like the lowest in 6 months...
All of a sudden, you realized you're a shit trader
i believe jan 9th
Fuck GYNA! Commies are Pure idiots!
This baba dip is our Christmas gift, buy in for free money tomorrow 🤑🤑🤑
#CATHIE FUCKED ME UP FOR CHRISTMAS
The next time zi see someone in this thread say “if you aren’t buying X you’re stupid/X calls today are easy money don’t miss put” I am buying OTM puts on that.
The US government will not shut down a business, CCP will without hesitation
I feel like TSLA is gonna stay in the 671-662 range until power hour when all of us small autists have sold off our 0d FD’s on RH and then moon 670
The market has been fucked up all year
We smokin that $Baba pak who wants a hit?
Shares so I’m good but man I’m getting jealous seeing all the other price movement out there.
That call is down 5% since I said no so that should be evidence enough. Plus China has complete control on their businesses and they could severely hurt the company with this lawsuit. I’m not saying it’s impossible to gain but not guaranteed
institutional investors don't gamble with their money. There's tons of other shit you can buy why risk it on a commie fucked piece of crap
I hope PLTR ends above 28.5
What expiration date?
3 day rule mayne let it dip 2 days and only consider buying 3rd + day
I sold my TSLA 660c yesterday at high thinking that Trump closed the market today :(
Holy baba
Just bought some CRM $227.50 calls expiring today on this big dip. Ready for it to bounce back up to the $229-230 range now.
Worst casino ever
TSLA carrying SPY. Damn get all these other volatile stocks outta my portfolio. SPY should drop AMZN and MSFT. Too volatile.
Got it. Thanks so much man! I was a bit worried lol
I cant believe im saying this but theres no way id buy baba at even these levels. China can do whatever it wants to fuck them over
Have faith that next weak will be crazy because today SUX
Positions?
Was debating 220C or 215P on BABA, guess which one I chose..damn it  &amp;#x200B;  215P
Lol just bought 2/19/21 105c for NET on the mini dip. Figured it’s longer so if it goes down at some point I have room to hold until it’s up again
BABA stop drilling plz 😞🔫
[removed]
Happy today's markets close early so I can only lose half the money I usually do.
Tmrw? When the market is closed?
Up 40% on my Jan 18 YANG $20 calls. Thx Chyna
China put bag holders in an open ditch and put the AKs on full-auto.
Literally the best Xmas gift for baba is that it's a half day and off tommorow.
[removed]
211, if it breaks that, 200 we go
210
HIVE on deep sale
it’s cuz baba is a stable investment,  it’s not rocket fuel.
Yeah makes sense, but the June 18th call for $41 is $3.83. The June $43c is $6.73.   The ETF right now is trading at $40.96
BAIL OUT BAIL OUTS ITS A TRAP
Because in China an antitrust case could fucking mean anything, based solely on the whims of the CCP. In the U.S. the regulators have to prove a case, and having good lawyers can actually help.
Fuck PLTR. all my homies hate PLTR. 😖
BABA put-holders booking private jets right now
Monday
Sooo is WSB dying after that rant yesterday by the mods? Or are we cool? I’m legit confused as fuck.
These Amzn and NIO calls are fucking burning what the fuck
We put BABA in a spliff
This is the worst weak of the year for me. Took me forever to save and build up to 5k only to lose it all on TSLA on Monday fuck me man. I got like nothing except for my phone and laptop and I room with some bums.
Green day and this place is in shambles
Cucked by Cathy
Yea. Lets see
perhaps, good luck
Well technically everybody. But institutional investors selling off BABA at a substantial loss because of paper hands.   Also didn't China just write up the laws last year?
Ask the shorters who shorted it at 16 and crying about it on /r/stocks
It was over when it lost that $220 hill.
Looking back, I probably have 2-3x more losses than wins but the wins are much much bigger than the double digit losses lmao. It's funny seeing so much red in the gain/losses tab but the winners are so big theyre irrelevant.
TDOC or Roku??
I’m in the optimistic phase about to head towards the hoping phase. Please Jack don’t make me get into the denial stage on Monday.
Closing at 12 or 1
Wholesome
Damn, BABA drilling your assholes hard. Merry Christmas 😂
Is PTON going to do that dumbass bull run again non stop upward
RKT is absolutely destroying me
1/8 mpc 45c
Isn't Christmas a mix of green and red but red for the most part?
I’m not in your shoes, but I really felt that. Your dad is proud of you, just feels bad for you that you lost your money. He probably just wants to talk.
Total shambles
Baba pak be hitting dif
These dips got me feeling 🥴
CRM is so stupid! I just exited my September calls 😤😤😤
SANTA RALY LFG!!!! 🎅
Today is the day to buy cheap....I just don't know what to buy.
Nice try!
BABA means dad and it is so disappointing and sad too. Good luck man, I'm sure you can make better investments in the future.
fucking averaged down so many times on SQ. Yes, because SQ should really buy Tidal. fucking idiot. On a short low volume day. Idiot.
The market is closed tomorrow
Yall jump on that SENS rocket. We going to the moon.
I finally figured out what it feels like in here. This is the virtual equivalent of standing at the craps table. I don’t know any of you personally, some of you make me laugh, some of you make me a little nervous, but at the end of the night we’re all standing here with the same goal ... beat the house and go home positive.
For Christmas, Wall Street is punching me in the balls
Are long dated BABA calls the play here? 2022 calls are so cheap
They were probably waiting for Christmas to do it
If RKT revisits $20 Ima shit
what rant?

Sorry man /:
our memes are dying 😭
And you were such a good boy this year too
the fucking balls on NFLX to keep asking me "are you still watching hentai porn" every 3 episodes.
I feel it. The disappointment from my dad was for me motivation to actually do well and be more patient with my yolos
Good. Healthy correction is needed.  Then buy more.
Oof, Baba is reaching March low territory now. Xi Jinputs
Lmao

Rip pltr 28.5c 12/24

Turns out, businesses get much friendlier incentives to operate somewhere else than CA.   Hence the huge exodus for years.

They're assholes to their wiggers too. We love wiggers in America, dime a dozen
I’m debating if the shit trader panic sells here or buys the dip.
A christmas gift from the MMs. A tech dip.
Man I’m still holding. My expiry is in February but fuck man...this stock sucks
Oof
I am also hurting but trying to buy the dip today to cost average
baba completely fuk
Why even have a half day when there's no volume and it's flat. Ring the bell
at least you've got pepe
ok im in the bargaining phase, if pltr manages to hold 28 today I'm ok with that
can anyone give me a tldr explain like im 5 reason why baba is getting hit with antitrust from china? i thought china has authoritarian leadership how are they getting antitrust-ed?
Yes
Just bought 700 GME and set limit sell at 200, to infinity and beyond amirite
BABA is officially down YTD
Thinking about it
GME frozen in time at 20.69. Bullish
Only if bankruptcy is your kink
good job autist.

Imagine entrusting the CCP with your money. Baba is dead!
how did I fkn lose 10 percent of my portfolio this week lel
I'm balls deep in DKNG, pls moon bby
STIC just drew a Batman symbol, quick.
How's that penny stock doing?
Yea they are overreacting.... BABA is still going to be Amazon of China
why would you expect a rebound on a company with a monopoly investigation pending on its ceo?
Appreciate it chief I’ll look for something else. Thought I’d buy the dip
Sell Jan puts the premium is nice
NFLX has hentai porn?  Sauce
yeah I always recommend checking OI/volume before opening a spread, and I typically do it on the monthly expiries cause those almost always have higher OI (so Jan 15, Feb 19 etc etc). You'll get a better fill most of the time and will generally be easier to exit when you need to.

Be sure to keep the receipt for that deduction on your Schedule C...
we're fine, as evidenced by this discussion
I don’t think PLTR is a scam, I think it’s a little overvalued but I know little about the company and have no positions so I can’t talk
was anyone here holding baba puts?
Institutional investors dumping, retard.  Keep bag holding
LOL
NIO crew, are you guys still bullish? I'm down pretty big on the Jan 2022 $47 calls I bought today and am wondering if I should hold. Will this BABA news continue to bring it down, or are you expecting a bounce back?
Is trevvy unloading nkla? Nikola is shitting bricks!
Tesla car/stock owner since 2013 here. Blink is shit compared to ChargePoint. They’re just riding the EV speculation wave. I’m not touching it. Look at SBE if you want to invest in EV charging infrastructure.
yeah just clench in short term and dont look at it
OK IRON FUCKEN HANDS ENGAGE
holy fuck nio
Don't sleep on large material suppliers, specially WY. I build houses and lumber yards are getting record orders. Contractors everywhere are already scheduling closing dates into JULY!! This shows no signs of letting up in the immediate future and with earnings coming soon I'd expect some serious 🚀🚀🚀
What’s the deal with baba ? Did murica declared war on China ?
0 please
Fuck it bough fubo at 44.50. Seeing 🤑🤑. my GME is the greatest suprise from WSB lately tho
Never gamble 100% of your net worth on options.... had you bought shares you would still be in the game.
AMZN calls fucking me but atleast its not as bad as BABA lmao
LMND puts, lock up expiring Monday. Let’s goo
Why not wait for a reversal instead of catching that falling knife? You might miss out on some gains but this might be nowhere near the bottom
[removed]
Welp today was a bust.
I rotated some of my portfolio into value and now my value is even red 😐😐😐
Merry Christmas fellas lost 3k today

Why SPY, why do you insist on going sideways
NIO calls making my pp soft
BABA went skydiving with a pack filled with knives and forks instead of a parachute
PLTR may be stabilizing around 28. Phew... only -$600
i hate FUTU what a fucking trash stock
I exited at $222. Overall an $1800 loss on BABA but I predict it will keep going down for many days, if not weeks. Chinese "regulators" have unlimited power.
I'm bearish on GME from this price point. This is a purely mechanical/technical move up and will almost certainly not hold.  I'm actually long on PLTR, couple of 25/30c spreads expiring in 3 months.
You just can’t match robinhood’s professionalism   [Check out the pre-written questions in relation to an assignment notification lmao. complete with the 😧 emoji and everything](https://imgur.com/a/Duoq1Dr)

Of course. This shits taking off at the beginning of the year. It's hella cheap atm.

Got the feeling some times the market just needs to be ignored, so it self-restart mooning again just to get back people's attention back.
Cathie gonna buy the BABA dip
🤌🏼
Take the profits and hop back in at 160
True, everyone has been spamming pltr and gme. Not like it's a terrible thing because that's literally wsb. Too safe and boomer to talk about on wsb unless it's going parabolic or plummeting I guess?
Wow BABA not even giving bounces to sell
Maybe Cathie thought today was the 25th 🤷🏻‍♂️
I have never played BABA, but is it worth getting in now on risky manipulated Chinese stock?
there’s gonna be a lot of sad bois at the Christmas dinner table this year
anyone else killing it with snap puts today?
I guess I am retarded enough to be here
What happened to BABA?
One of the Bisexual mods yeeted himself from the position. He's was one of our bois holding the line against the pump-n-dump scam bots.
My attempt to buy at the bottom of FEYE was about an hour too early
Zoom out to the monthly chart kiddo, relax
I hope so. My retarded ass has found a home with you degenerates and I have a new calling.. trying to become autistic
Hell I dont. I bought calls like a dollar below the top. I was up a little bit. Oh it will be good. Lost like 2000$ averaging down 0DTE. Fucking stupid.  Even CNBC said "why would they want that." idiot.
CRSR keeps hurting me and I keep coming back. It's like an abusive relationship. I love you baby
Lmfao bruh I left that shit. It literally fucks you every single time
As someone who has been hurt a lot  by BABA, I would wait.
Good.  Fuck NKLA aim its ear hole.
Fuck VLDR
it is in china...i think it's confused where it's going
What’s a good baba call quick retards!
BABA IS BIG DUMPING WTFFFFF
turn it off and turn it back on
GME shares
This is the way
Worth holding 260 March CRM calls?
Woh woh woh is that the Grinch trying to make an appearance at our party??? I'm ready to kick his ass and PUMP this party some more with gains lol
I don’t ski but there’s no reason why that wouldn’t work
It’s going down because people are selling today like retards because other people are doing it. NIO is going to have an insane run up after Xmas I would hold it’s not going lower after a day like this
Same I got ahold of some ARKK in my roth today.
Roku. They got the HBOMAX deal. Full house and clear market leader with number of users.
8800% on a 180p but I only bought 1 for fun :(
This stonk only goes up IMMA be Rich
CRSR having a sale right now. Get in now. 45+ in Jan.
Zero buyers for BABA right now
BABA black sheep, running out of wool.
NIO just cant fucking win
holy fuck Baba!! Jack Ma going bankrupt today
They disappear Jack Ma
Merry fucking Christmas.
Actually no floor for baba
SPCE doing SPCE things
Slept in and woke up to -8% of my portfolio gone so far. Merry Christmas
People around here think AAPL is a boomer stock cuz it can't go up 30% in a day. Except AAPL options have been printing tendies left and right and are way safer if you get em a couple months or a year out. Fucking zoomers circlejerking each other about MMs and short squeezes...
Probably 150
CRSR is my abusive lover. Who’s yours?
Reddest fucking green day ever
The CCP always wins. Go for strategic American companies like FCX, MP, and PLTR
are we buying BABA dip?
Lost 50% of my port lmao
Chinese government takes control of it and the stock goes to $0.
G H I V
BABA negative for the year. WTF
I'd like to place a new order. 😎
I’m banking on BABA back to $240 by EOY.
Yes, but its short volume is 30% and it keeps climbing up. Thinking we see a +20% day in the next few weeks. Everyone is jumping on the EV wave and BLNK seems solid. Short term hold or OTM calls a few weeks out should print
Smacking it often works better
This is a fake dump, VXX isn’t moving at all
Chineses largest e-commerce = TSLA (in market caps)
CLDR fucked me so hard
GME
Portfolio getting dicked raw with no lube by BABA right now. Really didn't expect this to go  below 215 wtf
Does Karp celebrate Christmas?
Anybody knows why C3.ai is dipping and if you think it’ll rise again 😅 asking for a retard friend
Hmmm, on second analysis maybe buying that BABA dip wasn't such a great idea. Who do I talk to about getting a refund?
That’s after Christmas
dont spit in the wind
Way too fucking high lol. I bought during the runup the other day.   I'm thinking after Christmas it'll trend upwards once the short report fizzles out. Depending on the velocity I'll either dip out at break even or hold.
hey shut the fuck up
I need gold to gap down on Monday. How did I get into this? 😞
&gt;	I’m in at 144$   Sure you are 😂😂😂
Buying Baba calls right now is soo retarded it just might work. HK only went down 8%, US down 16%.  &amp;#x200B;  What if Xi just wanted cheap calls?
XL
Go buy yourself a fucking scooter🤌🏼
Palantir will be up by at least a dollar Monday quick win
Who do I speak with about this gay underperformance on QQQJ...I was promised a better QQQ
Jesus how?
- eventual bankruptcy.
Being investigated
Arkg calls are down 26% guess I bought the top!!
how the fuck are baba calls not down much from todays all time high? wtf?
Baba is the exact reason you don't buy chinese stocks. Get too big? Make too much? Piss off pooh bear? The company is now the states, or they will just shut it down. Bye bye baba.
****YOUVE GOTTA BE A DUMB MF to not get FCEL on sale right now****
Going to dump a grand worth of credit from selling calls into GME before end of day, like a true retard. You don't have to buy to close sold calls, it's just free money.
Nio calls down 25%  CRM calls down 33%   don’t even wanna acknowledge my BABA calls 😭
220 exp 1/8/21
I said that last time it dumped from $300 to like $260  I got fucked today. I thought $260 was bottom  Fuck Chinese Stocks man
Baba Feb and March vibe af. Everytime you thought it couldn't possibly go any lower, it just does lol
Just found out there’s no Santa rally cause there’s no Santa 🎅
Cathie dump baba now bitch
Since when MSFT is volatile? It's been trading sideways for months!!
Phew I thought my 28 short calls on PLTR we’re gonna fuck me but looks like I’m safe.
&gt; CRSR   Same. I'm not sure why there is so much selling. I guess it just doesn't have meme potential, but solid company in my opinion.
BABA 5 EOD
C3.ai pump abd dump incoming, 180 target
It’s the Amazon of China they said.
So definitely no stimmy deal now. We’re gonna be RED unless they fix that shit
🐴BIO June ‘21 $5 calls
Yup I tried to warn everyone 2 days ago about it. I sold naked calls on those absolutely insane premiums. 75c jan 15 were going for 6 a pop hahah. Sold 10 of those easy 6k gain
BABA to the core
get into NET
crsr go up please
Sold TSLA calls and yolod into Baba puts. Pray for me
Fuck you NIO
Buying this PLTR dip. This is some fucking bullshit.
Fuck NIO
She boutta load up
Sell January $17.50 puts. Use premium to buy shares/calls. Infinite money hack. 👌
Baba black sheep Have you any wool? Yes sir, yes sir Three bagholders full
That's any chinese stock. It's the exact reason china will never lead the world.
the spreads on FEYE are dumb
It's on sale btfd
Santa has BABA calls
Can baba get below 200 by close?  Could be close
$0 CCP takeover
I’m a buyer of baba at 200
CRM is royally screwing me over
Why is still floating?
What dip should I buy?
Glitter is the herpes of the arts and crafts world. This shit never goes away
RMG 🚀
thinking ..
So many dips to buy omg yummmyyy free money. I love how people are hive minded and sell just because other people are, I just buy when everyone else is being a bitch and make bank the following days
BABA....
Xi
Just got called into HR because I told a coworker "Merry Christmas" instead of "Happy Holidays." Apparently what I said was offensive, not inclusive enough of all beliefs, and disrespectful to assume the coworker celebrates Christmas.  &amp;#x200B;  Just kidding that didn't happen. Merry Christmas everyone!
Not now...wait until 12/31
bruh i bought the BABA dip at 290. fuck me
I don't think I have seen any large cap crash this hard ever.      The only one that came close was TSLA back in September with the 20% down day.
No
Careful going full tilt like I am the past 2 days after consistent successful daytrading the past month.  I know to set stop losses below support because of stop loss hunters but I was so sick of losing I played more defensively, SQ dropped to barely touch $225 and immediately shot up to almost $228.  Tried to make back my 2K loss and turned it into 4K loss today, I’ll let my LEAPS rebound since they’re mostly ITM but damn loss alot of gains suddenly
Good shit! I bought some ARKG/F/K and MOON
Mr. BABA, I don’t feel so good 😞🔫
AAPL going strong
Got it. Thanks again for the tip mate. Appreciate it!!
I hope not, they should switch their BABA holdings to JD.
What a fuckin wash out, bois......
For the MMs to pump and dump for their xmas lambo
PLTR stocks
How do I do this? Do I need to own the shares
You must start every single story with  "SO THERE I WAS, REPEATING EXACTLY WHAT THE NEWS TOLD ME"   Cocaine Mitch is based as fuck and you don't know shit about fuck
ICLN just dove off a cliff 🤡
Note to self. NEVER trade thanksgiving and Xmas week again. These two weeks have single handedly wiped out my yrly gains
Is this the bottom for BABA or can it go down any further? Right time to get in for Calls? I know it's unpredictable, but what's your take on it?
I love how this POS CRM really has no bottom
Avoiding the ultra-leftist subreddits today.  I don't want to see those Maoist role players praise China for taking down their Amazon (in such a power hungry, no respect for private property method).
WMT is a tech company and a drug dealer. Bullish
Probably no buyers so the price hasn't actually updated at all. The people with those calls are going to be stuck with them until expiry unless BABA can somehow bounce back.
Oh yea that shits manipulated af u good
Oh no baba what is going on?
So today doesn't really count, right?
Unbelievable overreaction for BABA. Huge opportunity.
Absolutely.. you gotta be crazy not to
Merry Christmas
[removed]
If she does imma be so pissed
Wayfair puts are free money rn 🤑
HALT BABA HALT BABA RED ALERT 🚨 🚨🚨🚨
i've used it as anal lube before, so you can use it after you wear your assless chaps skiing too
It will by NiO day
Mm?
 ALIBABA HOLY FUCK WOW 213$ dude I did not expect this man    Holy shit   NEVER EVER TRUST BABA$ stock
Good day for my two biggest positions to be in BABA and SNAP lol
And.... CRM keeps plummeting.
I really just need to go to Vegas and cleanse my soul with strippers and booze for a few days.  Sigh....
PLTR traded their rocket ship for a submarine.
Anyone touching BABA?
-10% today,,, nice.
Crsr pleas fly again
Imagine thinking you know better than Cathie 😂
Yeah it looks like in september it bounced back up to 380 and november had strong support. I'm personally not touching zm since it relies on covid but it seems to have good support. Reminds me how nvda had insanely strong support on 480 for the past few months, it was great for a put credit spread.
Wtf is wrong with CRM
RKT mooning into the dirt
Fuck it I’m returning my fake Rolex from AliExpress.
Can we just fire said asshole mod? And promote z j z to head bitch?
THICCCC red candle on BABA🤡
closed (for a small loss) my 28.5 PLTR covered calls too early. Shoulda waited till the end of the day and let them expire worthless.  Ah well...
You think it’ll keep going up 3% everyday forever?
I would pay so much money to have access to a full time live stream following Jack Ma for the next week or so. Even more money than I already lost on BABA
This ARKK dip looking tempting
Who had BABA calls that were expiring today?
WHY EVER FUCKING SELL ANYTHING IT NEVER FUCKING MATTERS NOTHING MATTERS STOCKS ONLY GO UP A 1% DECREASE IN THE S&amp;P IS LITERALLY WORSE THAN THE HOLOCAUST IT CANNOT BE ALLOWED TO HAPPEN EVER AGAIN
Why sell?
BABA is one of the best examples that nothing matters besides momentum/fear.
BABA going under like it's about to go for a massive surgery
Going long, CRM or DKNG???
No its not.
I sold my calls at open for a 50k loss, glad I did.
Why PLTR is going down?
Could we get an F for BABA gang (including me)
XI pulls a Putin and Ma has to seek asylum in London.
thank the lord
forget Christmas can we just skip to Monday?
Knew it was coming, but I got absolutely faded today.
Lmao Fck you CRM
It's 1 thing to play a pump and dump.  It's another to hold a pump and dump thinking it's a long term hold.  So many of them here.
Healthy correction after being up every damn day almost?    Thats my guess.   Up 30% , up 22%, up 17%, down 2%  I buy the dips....  55% return since i got in (just stonks)
BABA 15 JAN 21 130 PUT  I think it's going to overreact a bit more before bottoming and bouncing back up like a psychotic roo.
When the dip keeps dippin...
Getting hammered today.. baba leading the charge to the toilet lol
Baba dip is more about ccp than anything. Global politics
Imagine investing in Jack Ma to fight Xi Jinping.
Hmm maybe I should’ve waited on these BABA calls... 🤦‍♂️
Sooooo GME is having a bigly Green Day on Tuesday so gather all your shares and calls two hours until the long winter 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
because theyre overleveraged to the tits
[https://i.ibb.co/Zgzvfcj/image.png](https://i.ibb.co/Zgzvfcj/image.png)  2 decent sized dark pool share prints just now   QQQ | 375,000 | $309.90 | $116,000,000  CRM | 1,000,000| $227.33 | $227,000,000
lol so accurate
 It halted??
210c
PLTR drill team 6
Only a select few win. Lottery!
Prett Pleas
My puts are printing hard
same 💔
BABA - STOP THE DROPPP
thank you for your service
How so?
Over reaction.
##Ho Lee Fook Baba
[removed]
Do people really think Gyna is going to kill baba
wtf...
Why am I Sitting here trying to make plays on Amazon and NIO losing thousands in Christmas Eve. I’m a fucking idiot
Some dude said he was going to edge himself until they passed the stimmy. Anyone want to check to see if his dick is still attached?
first day trading options and im up 7 percent. is the first one seriously always this free?
F baba
Tried to warn you
You can’t even buy puts on nikola because while they’re up bigly the premiums are so low cause no one wants to exercise these turds
Got this weird feeling China and BABA are in cahoots. This "antitrust" move by the chinese govt is just window dressing. China wants to show the business globe they hold their domestic companies accountable, so "please come foreigners, your business is safe here, there is no preferential treatment for domestic Chinese companies."
Gets bought by JPM and they start selling £1 cigarettes
not with a 10 foot stick til Monday
sir this is a wendy’s
Not so sure about that... chinas antitrust means a lot more than us antitrust....baba is barely red on the year
So fubo not gonna stop going down huh
well this is boring
🌈🐻 always have their day to do 🌈🐻 activities.
not every candle can be green. not every day can be green. it just doesnt work that way.
If you had calls oof
Stripper dust
buy the SRNE dip folks
market is flat yet my portfolio is down 10% what a classic
Just think that will all the money you lost on PLTR weeklies you could've just bought solid LEAPs from the start🤷‍♂️
Pls buy Put Credit spreads in danger
I really should give up, just losing money nonstop
Not been following NKLA at all, has Trevor sold out yet?
Christ they really killing baba. I’m so fucking glad I bought leaps Jesus
make it stop make it stop
Is NIO getting monopoly for investigation too?
Yes, it can go down. No, it probably won’t average 2% a day like the last month. But if you are disciplined Cathie going to make you some money
Jesus ducking Christ BABA wtf
Ok Palantir, it's not funny anymore.
I waste my day trades on the stupidest shit I swear. I might as well not have them.
[removed]
I guess now is as good a time as any to jump into PLTR. Was waiting for a good dip before buying.
All my shit is like 5% down. Omfg
Don't worry too much, I would imagine they will stack up some of the gravy from biscuit by proxy. I dont see their their balance sheets but I wouldn't guess that lumber makes up more than 20% of their overall profits
Not even considering it until it goes under $200.
If you removed BABa then you would leave a crater sized hole in your best economic producer. If the CCP wants to shoot it self in the foot. Then I guess that is their choice. But BABA can move it's head quarters. They are not forced to operate in CCP.
Down $300 from palantir, baba, ARKK Leaps.   Up 700 from Tesla.
rip pltr, but hold strong boys, itll be back
GME pls.....don’t do this to me.
Don’t worry boys! Everything is red today... hold strong!!!
nigga we at all time highs basically
Jesus when are they gonna halt BABA holy sheet
Grabbed one ☝️ might average up if it keeps drilling
let's see what the geniuses over at stocktwits have to say about BABA
You can call me a king because I'm being royally fucked by NIO and PLTR right now 🤴👑
No sir right to 25 please so I can drop a mortgage on it
F
Yeah. I feel like a spread is the way to go. But I'm feeling like spy 1dte calls @ 2% out isn't unreasonable. Congress knows they are about to get butt fucked by the new year if they don't do shit over the weekend.
HYLN and RKT are the grinches of Christmas
NIO at it's last support area around 45.60 then no mans land. F
BABA back to the 2010 xmas
Fun fact: the big boys get paid by what they have under management. It’s the end of the month, quarter, &amp; year.  Follow the big guys money as they pump their #s up just before they charge their customers....and then sell the profits the next day.
PLTR is in Denver. Lots of sunny days.
which dip should i fucking buy, so many of them
There is but he got Covid and he's super old so...
Yep pltr sucks, sold my put to early
WOW, WTF BABA. I am just sitting here watching my years of BABA gains vanish. WTF. Luckin 2.0
How tf is spy green
Short trading day with a closed market tomorrow.   Probably see a lot of selling off as we get closer to the 1:00 close.  I'm only a few months into this but each holiday week has had a small selloff.
I told you not to sleep on BTWN and here we are, rotation from Baba to Tokopedia
give it a good spanking for being naughty and give it coal for christmas
Copped 200 shares of GME @ $21.24, Merry crimbo cunts
Protip: It's a shit-tier stock
Gonna get higher
Yeah my put spread is dead
Is BABA even a buy at 200?
is this bc the $2000 stimulus was blocked by the reptilian republicans?
#NIO IM BEGGING YOU PLEASE
Real talk.
[removed]
Buying more dip than a Kentucky derby festival
Dude I are obsessed. It’s pathetic.   Stocks go up, stocks go down. It’s not the first note the last time this will happen. I guess it’s all new to you?
FUBO and BABA tryna outdo each other today
BABA pleas fly again!!!
I was looking at BABA 220C or 215P  Both were around 1.50, wetn with 220C, its down 60% already, 215P, up 100%.  all in ten mins
Q4 results.
oh god no please no
You think it’ll rise again?
hey if you're up on a day like today congrats! It seems like it.
I think your name suits you
https://i.imgur.com/NmZIAVM.jpg
Ouchie
Yeah ZM is spooky but 1/15 is a close enough expiration that I’m not super worried.
So after blowing up my account on weeklies, I’ve decided to become a more conservative inventor and put all my paychecks into long term PLTR calls. Can’t go tits up!
No mans land?
Like Buzz Lightyear, ARK is buy and hold for infinity and beyonddddddd
BABA 1Y graph looks absolutely disgusting
Thank you.
The CCP and PLA needs to be nuked.
Cool story bro
The $28 PLTR covered calls I sold on Monday is now OTM. Lol.  I wonder who held it for so long without exercising it. Fucking idiot.
why tf are people acting like PLTR is dead lmfao
Lol idiots ruining their own Christmas Eve with weeklies.
Webull has some really cool visualizations of potential profit etc.  Still not the easiest platform to use but they really have some potential
So you can buy one on BABA? Thanks for supporting the cause.
My wife's boyfriend is gonna be so pissed I second mortgaged our home on 12/24 $30Cs on GME yesterday :/
Made a small fortune buying NKLA puts when it spiked to 30 days before the lockup expired. Could there have been a more obvious play?
STOP THE COUNT
NKLA dead and buried
Down $300 from palantir, baba, ARKK Leaps.   Up 700 from Tesla.  Update: I’m down 400 now and up 600
Cost basis is 14.29. Balls fucking deep
This feels exactly like the half day before Thanksgiving
LMAO AND YOU GME CALL HOLDERS DIDNT THINK IT WOULD DUMP. LOOOOOOOOOOOL. TOLD YOU GUYS YESTERDAY. ITS GOING TO DUMP HARDER. GTFO!
I’m just not looking at RH today
moving my portfolio from $GME to $ROPE
Damn my ARKG calls are toast aren't they
A bit much on BABA lol
MM’s doing the most right now
Salivating at BABA. When it hits $200, buy $300 2022 LEAPs?
If only I learned my lesson...smh
RIP aliBlahBlah
Multimillionaire
It’s touching me, fffff. I just bought that dip today too.
My plan to buy the top was successful.
Glad I sold my BABA call for -50% yesterday instead of -99% today, cutting losers saved ya boy a rack
Coming here to comment my daily “Fucking PLTR”
thats already half complete
I think TSLA will keep YO-Yoing between 620-660.  Hard to say if market is pricing in them meeting delivery targets or not. Thats gonna be the next catalyst for some kind of movement outside of that range I'd imagine
Weedmaps SSPK pump hop on the train chu chuu
Yes
They entered their trades at open. They had no idea what they were in for. Now they're staring at six MMs with guns drawn. It was a fucking ambush.   This was a fucking bomb dropping on WSB. For a few seconds, this place was Armageddon!  #There was a SELLOFF!
PLTR on sale 🥂🚀🚀🚀
SELL SELL SELL
right? Not gonna lie I feel RKT is going to hit like 19.89 and then skyrocket to $23-25 just gut feeling
I should know better to play crm
Nah fam they're just warming up the fuel cells
Remind Me! 5 days
Haha you are all so fucking stupid on here holy shit
[removed]
Oof that sucks, sorry man. All my calls are March ‘21 or Jan ‘22 so I’m not too worried, just hope Dorsey isn’t going full retard on me
those leaps are still fucked no?
Buy a boomer ETF. Don’t knock consistent gains. After a year you’ll forget all about WSB.
Tech down left and right. Who let the Grich run the market today??
Why am I still buying RKT :(
Also depends on if you file jointly or single.  By ya that’s pretty much correct.  Unless you live in Puerto Rico for 6 months out of the year then you don’t pay any capital gains taxes after you move there on new positions.
Amazing how quickly my account turns red. What a showing by baba and PLTR
Yep, me too. Followed Cathie like a retard.
Baba calls are still dummy expensive
employee dump
Calls on literally anything are free money today. The next 3 months are about to be a beautiful bull run
I would think about buying the dip if my ass didnt look so red goddamn
They're selling off BABA like it's going bankrupt or somethin'
Fucking a PLTR. I keep averaging down on my 30c 1/15s but I'm almost out of money. Should I stop and just wait it out?
Well it’s been a great week overall if today’s gonna be a red day at least it’s over by 1pm
Oof
Tell me why I shouldn’t offer my first born on baba? They actually make money
Dear Diary, Today I lost 3k on BABA. My monthly portfolio gain wiped out
Touching your BABA sounds kinda dirty...
What y’all think of MDB?
Wow Merry Christmas
Is BABA still a value stock or a value trap?
Jesus god bless all the Baba put holders. Fuck
rip anyone with baba calls, now theyre red for the year
My 650 0dte still running.. Hope you are wrong!
baba die
fuckin pltr bitch fly the fuck again
Buy the fucking dip on PLTR
Close sesame...
They passed it, so I think he'll be all right. Unless he's waiting for a re-pass overriding the veto.
Xi canceled christmas, the way he intended
aliBAbA iNtElLiGenCe 🥴
Well she bought baba at 260
GME big sadness. Holding though we aren't pussying out of this shit
Stop the BABA
buy the Tencent dip! free money!
Bruh im not even going to log on, everything shitting the bed super hard
I’d risk $2K on it, at that price point.
oh fuck. Calls on IPAs. best beers out there
We’ll get em next year boys
Wth was that GME sell off
Is RH desktop down?
Will MVIS rise again 🧐
Must be investment firms selling off to close out the year
🐻 nation
Tfw you wanted to buy STIC yesterday, but E-Trade refuses to make your funds available until the 30th for no fucking reason.     Feels bad.
i'm not exactly bullish on baba, but this thing has lost like \~30% of it's value in \~2 months.  it's not like their revenue is tanking, so exactly how much lower should it be expected to drop
Fucking Polar bears ate Santa.
[removed]
Palantards, how y'all holding up?
WHY
youll never ammount to anything, son
Nio peas pie in flame
LOL low volume moves and you think this is it? Remind me Monday
I think institutional brokers are running it down in toe with one another to squeeze as much profit into 2021 as they can.
BABA is negative for the year LMAO
Godfuckingdamnit
Great time to load up On ARKK leaps
If y’all ain’t buying up BABA calls/shares I donnnnnttttt knnnnooowwwwwwwww what else to tell you
RIOT and VLDR FUCKING ME
It just keeps dipping. I though 220 was the floor
If you are buying BABA shares just sell a put instead (if you can cover)  Premiums are high right now
Chill dude it’s gunna fly just wait for it
27 is the "fuck over all weeklies" number
G  E  V  0  having a big day  Let’s go boys
Cue outcast
Holy shit baba is sitting on its 100MA with WEEKLY candles. This is either a great buy or the fucking end LOL.
That's why it dumped lol
No shit retard
Let’s all say it together: GUH
Fuck it bought 30 shares in BABA to hedge against my fucked calls 🤡
I'm 2022 4C. Cheap ass 13 month lotto tickets.
BABA red YTD hahahaha
If my Mom didn’t get me the Patagonia vest I wanted for Christmas I’m going to go ballistic. Everybody is a stock trader now these days. My robinhood app no longer tells people that I’m a Finance guy.   Luckily, the Patagonia vest hasn’t been adopted yet. But, if I don’t get this vest, how will Stacy know I’m in finance and not just some marketing nerd when we talk at the water cooler on Monday?   I used to just leave my phone sitting on the table with robinhood open but now even Rick in maintenance gives me stock tips. Buddy, do you see the vest? Okay, I’m in finance. I don’t need a guy wearing Carhartt telling me what to buy.   This has been the worst year ever.
I dump a lot into my indexes every year. Just figured I could maybe have a minor degree of success with this shit but clearly I was way, way wrong
Low volume. Gonna wait for the bleed all day and then enter before close
BFT getting its Dick a lil wet today
Holy fuck BABA
NKLA and BABA digging to find the bottom first...smh
perfect time to hop on this FCEL dip 🚀🚀🚀
Yeah i dumped it too. I just looked it in the eyes and realized i didn't love it anymore.
R.I.P. my 14,000 shares of PLTR
I think alot of people are loosing money today
Baba down 100$ since top
Almost bought BABA $300 January expiration 😤 glad I trusted my gut and not the sub
[removed]
ok friend. DIamond hand  turn it off and come back monday. were still so far up this week were good.  Unless you are dumbass that has shit expiring today.
Jack Ma you Minecraft headed mofo, why couldn't you keep your fucking mouth shut back in November?      Fucker singlehandedly wiped of billions in market cap with 1 fuckin sentence
somebody need to pass the morphine drip to these baba bros out here
Guys it's right before Xmas. We knew everything would go down. If you sell PLTR now you are a moron and a coward. The UK just signed a deal with them yesterday.
So we’re gonna get cucked again with stimulus.   SPY 360 12/28
I actually cannot believe this BABA shit. There’s no chance they keep this up for long this is such an overreaction
Going for the Derry Mckesson look
I'm getting fucked good today
PLTR you stupid ugly whore. You’re gonna knock my 1/15 calls OTM soon. Cunt.
F it, I just got in on some LEAP's... Can't go tits up.
For some reason I woke up and said "lets chase some shit." stupid.

That's why you buy shares on GME, not options. Buy shares, we keep telling you, why are you not listening. WHY ARE YOU NOT LISTENING.
It's a few weeks. Do you have calls or what do you have?
Baba how deep is ur love
Don’t forget 1pm today
I did unfortunately

Really want to see it again, sauce?
Can someone please explain the crazy volume for $BILL 130p 1/15
GME available shares to short went to 4K from 150k at 945 am this morning before going back to 150k by 10am. The war is on
As a Chinese:  IMAGINE BASING YOUR ENTIRE PORTFOLIO ON BABA WHEN NEWS OF POWER STRUGGLE BROKE IN OCTOBER LMAOOOOO THERE'S A REASON CHINESE AVOIDED IT LIKE PLAGUE DESPITE THEIR PROFITS
Bad day. Wait for alibaba goes to 190
Why isn’t baba being halted?
PLTR been doing this for a month.  why is everyone surprised.
[removed]
If you have to ask you need to do some googling before fucking with options lol. But to answer your question, no you don’t need to own shares to sell puts. You either need level 3 options approval or you need cash to cover the cost of the shares if you were to be assigned

Christmas sale!
I’m learning my lesson when trusting this sub LMAO lost everything in PLTR... just lost 60% of my portfolio in GME lmao
I can’t believe people sell Stocks like NIO and Xpeng when they are at the low point before a bull run. People are literally so stupid it hurts to imagine it
My tickers rn: You get to see a new daily low! and YOU get to see a new daily low!! and BABA let’s take you back to June lows!!!
Volume is very low, as you can see from the whole day it is making big swings, I wouldn’t look into today too Much
I just sold. 3k loss today baby
Me too buddy, me too.
Its a joke relax
Baba is dead
I thought y’all said it was illegal to be red on Xmas eve ? 😐
Described as a "corporate husk". Got them a Shitron style hit piece.
Usually for the holidays I’d think about spy calls but I feel like there’s more catalysts for it to drop this year
woa...lol  any show polish around? might be better?
I haven't been this poor since Tuesday. It's rough.
[removed]
NIO might dip down to 40 before reattempting \~49/50 again.  Look at the chart, it's trading in a range: \~38 lower, \~49/50 upper.  I put a 'feeler' call into play, waiting for it to tap the lower bound and head up a bit before adding to my position.  March calls.
Nio is a buy rn. Keep watch for a dip and enter. The only reason it's down is because of BABA and maybe because calls expire today. It'll push up to the NIO day on Jan 9th.

Very smart
What strike on PLTR?
The rally is a made up story and Santa is actually a power bottom
They’ll let it die
This day has been very cool, very legal 😐
genuinely shocked my JD calls are only down 7%
😳🐻
GME BTFD
This was the toughest trading month this year
It’ll be back. Damn near everything’s red hahaha
Why Santa gotta be like this give me 📈
Unusual whales plays have been a joke lately  He posted a baba 237.5c 12/31 with a premium of $2.7 that’s not sitting at $1.67 lmao thankfully I didn’t buy that   He also posted RIOT $9p 12/24 last Friday - that unfortunately I did play like a cuck
GME pls
PLTR bounces here.
Jesus sorry man.
pltr has consolidated between 25 and 28 lmao

Wish I didn’t paper hands baba twice
Hey did you know market closes at 1pm today?
I guess today's red was kind of expected after this green as fuck week
What's the play for NIO day
My dude it is down 1.5% today after being up 29% the past week.  We're fine unless you bought OTM calls expiring today.  But this has always been a play for like, March or April, so.
Baba basically same price as it was two and a half years ago.  That’s wild.   Could’ve made a killing with so many other options
Xi is going to use that little bastard Jack Ma as a hood ornament on his Hongqi L5 for the next 2 months or so and then let him go out in the Hangzhou wilderness.

Go tell your parents you think unemployment, Medicare, social security benefits and programs like the New Deal were all bum programs and should be eradicated. That’ll make ‘em proud of your education
Why am I up 10% on my BABA calls I bought it at 215 💀

PLTR fucked hedge funds and shorters so hard that they will risk going under just to make sure it never hit 30 EOY.
PLTR going green today would truely be a Christmas Miracle, please papa Karp, make it happen.

BYE BYE BABA
Vote is on Monday
Next support for BABA? $169 March 23 lows? lol
I know how you feel, brother. I had 25k in airlines and JPM in June that went all down the drain.
now from the top make it drop
Technicals mean nothing when the country your based in can just take the company.
I'm sure you be okay, but still:  F
LGVW and the THIC one were up so nicely at open, smh
VLDR breaking down. Need it to find support around the 24 mark so that it can ascend in the future months. My $30 LEAP (December ‘21) was sitting Golden a couple of days ago. Now back to the slow grind
Oh fuck I was wrong about GME. No moon today bois. We moon soon

Anyone thinking about buying into this BABA dip? Thoughts?
My friend put his life savings into BABA like 4 months ago and talked mad shit to me.  What now bish?
I was green 1% last week  I'm green 3% this week  What am I, a pension fund? Asking Santa for some bigger ballls for Christmas, seems my current ones are shriveled jujubes
Yo which dip do I buy?????
oh im dipping the fuck outta here on the next trading day unless xi himself comes and personally pegs jack ma on live tv
twitter has delay, thinking of buying the subscription
Long dates?
Well, there goes my first week trading options, feel like I picked a horrible week to start. God fucking damn is this shit a roller coaster ride. I honestly don’t know how some of you take 2-10k losses so well, regardless of your portfolio or financial situation. I guess I’ll get used to it.  Only lost like 500 which I’m sick over but I feel the lessons I learned were almost worth it.  Let’s get filthy rich next year you dick heads🥂
Holy shit BABA.
100s of billions
Haha try 30% over here at 218 I’m loving it
Dalio must be feeling pretty bad right now. His 42 year old son dies earlier in the week, and now his china baby, BABA, dies on friday.   Dalio, if you're reading this, I'm sorry buddy.
Bull case for ICLN in 2021 is Dems will talk big game about clean energy initiatives and every time they do that ICLN will go up. Then the big pump comes from when they actually get a bill together on clean energy
even this sub said to buy stocks not options on gme
F
You're playing an ETF, they usually move like molasses.
lol RIP to that dude talkin bout how u just buy spacs and its free money
Options are stressing me the fuck out. Another week of winning at the beginning of the week just to lose it all and more by the fucking end
Holy fuck PLZ STOP THE DRILLING BABA. Worst christmas ever.
I got burned bigly last rug pull and learned no matter how much potential this stock has, it is toxic waste until this anti trust stuff is resolved. That being said, if it goes to 200 it will be very temping.
Everything is down but SPY is up...ok
Baba
XL showing signs of life
ICLN
Buy the baba dip?
BABA should bounce back, this kind of shit even happens in the US where the government all of a sudden decided to “break up” a major company. You’ll see the share price fall drastically but it’ll rebound within a year.  Just a ploy at insider trading. Chinese politicians probably shorted BABA last week. US did the same thing recently with Apple and Google.
Meh. Hoa Karen is worse

We’re literally down $2 on the week wdym

Why NVDA acting like baba
Goddamn BABA keeps tanking. My shares are down 30%. I switched from options to shares but somehow I bought a lot of shares of BABA on a whim at the peak
Look what they did to my boy bAba
Should I sell my SPCE 7/16/21 $27c’s or diamond hand?
Out until further notice

Good call. Merry Christmas!🎁🎄
Remember boys. If you don’t feel strong about any play in particular, just give your money to Elon. 100%
I want to see some BABA loss and gain porn for Xmas
I just want it to be like $30 and push to $32 by my expiry
Portnoy has a big position in BABA. RIP
NIO/Xpeng for free huge short term gains
Holy fucking BABA!
At this point, wait until under $200
XL TRUST
youre welcome
WSB is literally the twilight zone
Bought them yesterday so like not down so bad
Rip
[removed]
Haha I literally lol’d at this so thanks for brightening my day. If it’s any consolation, I meant to sell some March $300c against my Jan ‘22 300c and accidentally bought the March $300c and sold for an immediate loss of $50 each
BTWN
Get in on ROLLS ROYCE before next week!
Paper Hand pussies have been shaken out. Time for FCEL to hit that Christmas Rally 🚀🚀
Lol I feel like that’s a pump and dump account. Usually the options they post shoot up in value and decline back to normal after
God speed brother
if I were you, I would
Jesus BABA... glad I'd already lost my money elsewhere so I couldn't try to catch that falling knife
When did shitron say that? You have the link?
Bought BABA at $225  FML
Cowards running before the squeeze
Yep April and May 💯

I have baba leaps and I’m down 60 pct   What the actual fuck

Damn, BTFD gang fucking me up!!!
[when you buy the BABA dip but it dips 10 times more](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/031/671/cover1.jpg)
Shares. We told you to buy GME shares.
fuck outta here lmao
Hope that BABA quits fucking it up for everyone is the only play for NIO right now. People are too retarded to do any DD and realize NIO is actually backed by Chinese government and plays ball with them. Instead they see BABAs issues and "hurr durr all China stocks bad"
[removed]
BABA BIG FUCKED
Why
WTF BABA
So i’m the only one out here positioning for a gov lockdown on Monday?!?!?
492%
My entire portfolio is getting slained but DASH stays afloat !! 🤡🤡
My read on it would be that China can and will randomly nuke any company within its borders (because Jack Ma said some bad stuff). That doesn't seem like a good signal for foreign investment.
[removed]
[removed]
Damn even the Chinese dont fuck with Chinese companies...smart.
Good thing my $90K in 20C,25C,30C  calls expires May
Shoulda bought oil calls, long global warming and fuck polar bears
can arkg continue to go down so i can buy please thank you
Wait. Not even a dip to buy into rn.
Don’t FOMO if you really have to make sure the stock has not passed 2 percent. Buy the dip, and never play earnings.
Holy fuck i got slaughtered today, just woke up  MT, C, MS, PLTR, RIOT sell off and all my calls are fucked  SWEET
bruh imagine buying it at $290
TDOC
I been saying today will be a sell off going into a 3 day weekend. I fucking told you all
Wait till the day ends
Imagine thinking this week was green af lol 🤡🤡🤡
If you sold today go chew on concrete
Not a bad idea, however I bet the Chinese anti monopoly police have a little more leverage there than here.  If they do fail it will be a super bull
out of FEYE at $23.. could be worse
nice
Fuck a Melvin all my homies long memestop
Probably because y’all are the only ones buying baba 🥴
Did I just hear the faint white of a printer?
Wait what
I bought tons of SSPK warrants at the top. AMA

How the hell is my entire portfolio red and every index is green?
I'd hold off until after New Years
If the market could just close that'd be great
I’d cum
SQ
AMD HATES MONEY I GUESS
With the way its dropping youd think CRM was the one who blocked the stimmy
godspeed to you
This is why I love options   You could have bought 20 BABA 12/31 230p for $30 each = $600 total   Now there worth $19.00 a piece = $38,000
Yeah that's pretty bad. Sorry about your day.
FCELL about to burst. Paper hands have been shaken off and volume is increasing! 📈
True but this has been an ongoing saga for me
If you believe you have the worst luck and happen to be bagholding BABA, take one for the team and sell so BABA can moon.
Part of me genuinely believes BABA might not be an overreaction. CCP could annihilate that company.
HAHAGAHA TIGGERED BABA HOLDER IM DUMPING MORE NOW !!
[removed]
....did I blow my load too soon then?
my degenerate 0DTE contracts agree with you
We will win
except you never know what the CCP is capable of. I myself think this is over cooked, but you just don't know.   plus, BABA is already pretty weird from corporate structure standpoint, ADR investors don't have a lot of protection.   However, yes, usually a good thing to buy during blood in the streets
Good Point.  What is the next entry....$190?
If you don't buy this dip, you ain't chinese
Are $ROPE stores open on Christmas Eve?
I'm not selling!!!!    Holding psth, mt and stic    Just think of this as paying less in taxes this year
I kind of wanna buy this BABA dip but I don’t trust chinese companies and unduly influence the gov can exert on them
ARKG rug pull 😡
Why is Corsair tanking again lol
FSLY sold off more than BABA did for less
That's fair. Best of luck to you
Sold my other half at the top. Ill take it.
Lmfao everything down besides TSLA Falcon launching past the moon rn

Why they are killing it today and have been all week?
Got 2k give me something good to hold over the weekend
That FUBo drop is crazy given all the recent price upgrades
TSLA market cap higher than BABA  LOLOLOL
ARKG WTF
Am I able to display my RH portfolio on a big screen outside my house and call it festive decoration?   This shit is flashing red and green
Man...you were right....
Bought the PLTR dip
Wait to see what the wedges do before throwing your hand down. They will tell you when it’s going to go up or down.
Brexit is over
WISH down 3.5% and my calls are only down 5% lol
Okay BABA you filled your gaps, turn the fuck around.
Very few things are free money lol.
Fuck yah. You know I am. Bout be 5K on at EOD.
On Christmas Eve, both bears and bulls have something to celebrate. BABA may be in freefall, but TSLA is pumping.
cause yours calls already down 92.9%
Will dividend auto reinvestments show up in my total return on the stock?
It wasn't Shitron, just that style. It was [Hindenberg Research](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/microvision-mvis-short-seller-hindenburg-research).
You got a good fill, option premium went up more than price drop
Hope you didn’t have calls. It’ll go back up in a couple of months. I swear there’s no stock that is more affected by news on China more than this one. All the trump threats affected the stock immediately then it went back up. Been burned many times over. This time will be no different.
probably not since it has such a large revenue flow but who knows/
And just like that I’m in the red  Whatever, this week was nice and January is close enough, I’ll survive.
Same 🤑🤑🤑🤑
u/RayTDalio sorry for your losses on your son and BABA  #F
Free dips on a bunch of stuff!
Good to be back on Elon's moon mission
Such easy money to play the swings. Might miss out when it finally breaks through but it is what it is
Just a reminder that it's only money. Unfortunately, money buys shit.
Lmao that does put a smile on my face!
GH..IV PRINTING DOE
Anyone gonna buy leaps on BABA?
yeah... imagine....
Fuck you spy im holding these 370 calls
There’s your resistance on BABA
I bought BABA today at bell -8%. I got jaded I didn't realize it's now -17%. Nothing is real
I bought the 370/380c call debit spreads for 1/15. If it closes above 380 on 1/15, I’m Gucci
It's truly amazing how dysfunctional the US govt is.  It looks like yet another shutdown is going to happen, even if it is short.  The US govt can't even fund itself to stay open, which happens almost every. single. year at this point.  COVID relief, which should be an obvious, can't even pass after months of bullshit.  Every single minute thing has to turn into an ideological WWF Summer Slam cage match brawl that goes on for forever.
who?
3 day rule
Looks like Baba's fnally turning around 210 seems to be the bottom
Its China...a thousand years is short term for them
I love how tsla is just dancing while the market is on its period

Yeah. HK -8%, US -16%  I'm thinking they know more about the CCP than we do here
LISTEN RETARDS XL REVERSAL IS NEXT WEEK HOP IN THIS DIP OR CRY LIKE GME HOLDERS
Someone reassure me that this is an overreaction on BABA
🤡s in here told people to buy the BABA "dip" at 280 lmao tHE ChiNeSE AmaZOn
"but this week was so green" lol. Like a handful of tickers were green this week but idiots acting like this was a green week around here.
Oh my god, loss porn would be red. Gain porn would be green. THOSE R CHRISTMAS COLORS
no, don't do that at this current IV.  Sell put credit spreads, or buy call debit spread.
Do I swap BABA for PLTR?
Let’s see if spy can hold. I have spy puts rn to balance out some of my calls
Sweet CRSR sell off
My take from this is that stimulus checks = GME moon  Mooned when they confirmed 600$ and died when confirmed no checks until next week
at this point i’m fucking done with chinese stocks i’m going to hold on to what i have and hopefully break even within the next year
Down $7. Nnever going to finanancially recover from this.
So it's actually 5:30...  [http://letmegooglethat.com/?q=What+time+does+the+market+close+on+christmas+eve](http://letmegooglethat.com/?q=What+time+does+the+market+close+on+christmas+eve)
Yup and my calls thanks it, cashed out too bby
Just dumped by BABA leaps for a -99% loss 🤡 rolled whatever's left into puts, leggo!
That’s when you sell the news.
BABA....scorched earth....
Dang, 1k in BABA 250P yesterday at close would’ve been worth &gt;100k 🥴
The fact PLTR is still going up week by week despite this daily immense downward pressure is amazing
Idk if to hold thru or sell the news
Quick EOD call to make lunch money what’s everyone got????

Im not worried about the GME dip today, but its really not gonna be fun having to look at this big ugly red line on rh until monday lol
F
Up 50% still, bought them monday and had two +3% days after
anybody buying a 660 p on tsla?
Buy BABA leaps?
I just need it to drop 3 more dollars in before end of day.  Otherwise I'm poor
What is the deal with TSLA? Is this stock going to 1000 or what? I keep selling puts and betting against Elon and I keep losing! FML
Can’t believe jd is dropping too, I really thought I had a big brain play
Christmas Eve portfolio massacre in fucked
You mean support?
Power hour at 12-1 and pretty much everything is flat or dying
BABA 12/31 P's
Could go to 189
just be patient if you wanna ride the amd wave their ER will come and so will ur tendies.
Buy the FEYE dip???  1/2022 30c
Missed the bottom by a lot when buying up.  Ah well, nice to have positions sorted before I go away.
Bought GME this morning   This is nice
That's far enough out for them to do another flight attempt. I say hold it until the day before the next test flight.
I don't know how high it's gonna get, but I don't plan on selling for a bit
I don’t hold baba and never will.  I’m just tired of idiots like yourself spamming this thread with unfunny garbage, you are unoriginal, boring, idiotic. Let the others meme. You should be on the forums of yahoo finance, you fucktard
Alexa stop playing bulls on parade
BABA 100 EOY
now if PTON could tank, that'd be great 🚴🏼‍♂️📉
Dumped all LMND yest at $135 phew
Regardless SPY goes up
Are those FDs? Maybe. Theta decay still hits tomorrow but I wouldn't lock in a loss greater than 30%. We could rocket up at anytime.
Nothing like losing over 7k Christmas eve! How fun
I Bought BABA LEAPS !! Happy now? I said it! Lol
its prob just a temp pull back but i want to hear about the WSB bro that finally fomo into GME at 21+
XL is starting that late-day U-Turn. Get in while you can.
Why am I in NIO calls again?  Did I think it was seriously going back to $50 soon?
Tsla go ⤴️ call contracts value go ⤵️
Baba a buy at $200 weekly support?
If it doesn’t seem to be breaking out I’ll probably sell next week or the week after while its still got some extrinsic value
Daddy pow
More like CCP wanted to buy another aircraft carrier so they shorted BABA
GME down .33 cents and it’s going to cause mass panic lol. Hold your shares retards. We aren’t going to moon everyday of the week. Resume moon mission next week. Stop buying weekly calls.
Imagine this happening to amazon
R we buying baba long?

Dude only place to go from here on WISH is up. I jumped on the bot with you yesterday. Bought july calls because when this catches fire it will double
To all my fallen BABA soldiers:  GUH!  This war is not over.
Yeah, i feel the same way. I think this is the top. And to make it worse, I think we are at a point where as things get better, tech will sell off more offsetting the gains from travel, industrial stocks
Thankfully my 20k reup doesn't hit rh until Monday apparently
I don't think we will see any crazy moves till after the 25th. Everything seems on auto pilot ,cept BABA . Poor bastards.
I’m seeing that I was completely wrong. Brb investing in $ROPE
No, it doesn't.  In fact, I should have a flair that reads, "ain't learned shit".  I've stopped trying to learn shit, I'm actually making a bit of $ by following meme pumps and the occasional yolo.  The BABA play is a premium flip with no ITM expectation.  Total gamble, but I'm willing to risk a little $ on it.
The indexes are green, but I'm getting destroyed. Down 1.8%. I won't financially recover from this until Monday 🤣
It didn't pass before because of election garbage. Now Trump is slowing it down because Trump.
SANTA HELP US!!!!
Bigly red dips are your gifts to open up after Christmas.
AMD lets go
TSLA is a rock
Buy ARKG dip?
Weeklies
according to the candles. FCELL is about to burst 💸
just logged in how are my BABA calls doing?
It’s actually hilarious baba dies because the ceo said 1 bad thing and the dictatorship does an antimonopoly law. Do they not see the irony!!! Ugh
BABA - Black Sheep 🐑
Anybody else getting in lulu  Will have a blowout Xmas with all these home gyms
It's ok. Our option will exercise automatically if Tesla closed above $700
germany caught the uk virus... i just all inned puts cause this shit is only gonna spread
[removed]
Bought a lot more PLTR shares on that dip
Ur an animal
My boy BABA getting slaughtered before christmas
Bought one for 09/2021 $250c
I'm mortgaging my house and buying leaps with it then
Ya, I am trying to find stocks that are up. Tesla is probably pulling SPY up, but not sure why Dow is up.
Will do thanks man
Oh geeze.
This dude on Bloomberg saying we don’t need 2k$ while on his HUGE house, fuck that guy
Who knows who. It's down 17% in a day on a government investigation. Beyond insane.
You need to zoom out on your charts my dude.
Burst down.
Index up but all stocks down. Cool
I ain't seeing any BABA loss porn yet 😤
His hot water he doesn’t pay for lol
M V I S 🚀 going to the moon
I just realized, the 12/24 call holders must be getting crushed due to IV drop from 1 pm close.  damn, sorry fellas
If gme tests the 20 dollar mark then we going to 25 by EOY
Too risky betting on individual EV/SPACs so why don’t I just put everything on ETFs that track ALL of their losses at once hahaha :(
Wanna know the power of diversification? Have 10 stocks and all 10 are deep red. Fuck diversification.
Str8 up bought leaps of BABA it keeps going down but my profit keep running up - so I’m glad I chose the right month
[removed]
Is this a buying opportunity for BABA or are we going to be seeing it dip even more...?
Say it sith me: **CHYNA IS FUK!!**
Id think MM are equally as retarded as us, so they also lose money
yeah been waiting for awhile for this to brew. thats ok ill leave a bit of ammo to avg down
Well today BABA play shut the bed but you’re right about the aapl one it did hit like 20% the day it was posted but I missed my chance to sell  The RIOT one was an instant fail too  Have to be wise licking the plays but it can be a mind fuck with the volume on some of them
My faith in CRM has been destroyed. These calls are fucked.
?????? the underlying is down 16%...
After experiencing March, one decently red day on portfolio doesn’t even phase me anymore 😤
RIP
BABA$   INVESTORS   WHAT HAVE U LEARNED !!!    Please tell me u won’t do the same stupid shit on Monday like learn from your fucken mistakes
Same
FUCK YOU MMs. You aint taking ma money! #cashgang
Merry Christmas! Now get in the bread line 🤬🤬🤬
Is baba going to recover ...?
Loving these minute-by-minute updates.
Everything red on my list except for the OG meme stonk TSLAAAAAAAA
Larry Summers getting paid by big business to say 2000 stimmy is bad for us. Fuck this guy.
We love some ark dips

MT &amp; LOW realllllyyyy testing my patience.  6th day going negative
BTFD isn't working on FUBO. I'm crying in shares.
ARKG and ARKK dipping on no volume ahead of the long weekend. It’s time to load the fuck up!!
Yeaaaah let me buy this gme at 20
Anything worth jumping into today? Need some cash
I don't know why calls are so cheap especially with how volatile it is, good luck to us fam
SPY fall to 367 before noon please ty
That’s what I meant. Thank you! Trying to put together Christmas toys for the young one.
BABA retards post loss porn, the most important thing you cucks can do today instead of staring at the rope hanging off your kitchen fan
its fine only a few leaps. worst case i baghold/sell weeklies against it.
My buy order is at exactly 210 so hopefully it hits and moons.
I’ll show you something that’s about to burst
&gt; rebound within a year.  Sure, in time.  But right now that knife is falling and you're more likely to catch the blade than the handle.  I'm going to steal another Redditor's comment and say that how China handles this says a lot about how foreign investment should look at China. If they nationalize BABA get everything out of China. If they fine Ma with a slap on the wrist then and move on then buy Chinese stocks. Both of these represent extreme ends of the spectrum, what actually happens will fall in between.
Everything is losing. Just hold strong. This is a dip if I’ve ever seen one.
Man your asshole is leaking cum from the Pounding bears are giving u
Lmao it’s over over
Fantastic, if you flip your screen upside down
I like this. This makes me feel better. This is what I’ll believe.
Lolllll. Stop. 👜
Been hearing that for a month.
guys, CRM is maxed out for growth. they don't have an easy path to enormous revenue growth anymore.   beware
We were promised a santa rally
Consolidation is for the bulls
Let's not forget our own idiot leader put some major dents in our Christmas rally this week as well.
SPY $364p 12/28 locked and loaded
My screen is a fucking bloodbath right now. So red.
I told people not to buy the dip. You don’t fuck with the CCP
[removed]
FCEL bros it's time to buy the dip 🤑
AMZN at its pinch point
CCP just wants to flex their power, they know better than to completely upend a major domestic retailer like that.  But yeah, Chinese stocks are always inherently a gamble for the reasons you mentioned.
You see the interview with Elon Musk and Jack Ma?  TSLA should be multiples higher than BABA.  Only a fool would not sell BABA stock after watching that interview.  Jack MA is a moron.
Nobody wants to sell
It is clear that the greatest risk to GME Moon Mission is the weak hands who panic over a 1.3% down day after +25% ... Folks just need to buy and hold shares and we will make Melvin and the boomer fucks burn
Raise your hand if NIO is hurting you rn
Anyone lose big on BABA?
STOP THE COUNT
Alibaba intrlligence!
For someone who’s never messed with BABA before, would anyone consider this a good entry point?
my Tesla call expires today even though it's up $50 since I bought it, because the premium was so high I'm only going to make like $80 stupid premiums
meme stonks are fuk
Not much difference from a normal Friday.
Oof Apex wrong way go back to the moon 🥺
How do you steal hot water? Like do you have to buy the right for a certain amount of units of water to not reach thermodynamic equilibrium?

The day I decide to buy ARKG :(
Holding?
As I have been saying since forever- Fuck China and everything that comes out of there
work done for the week, office closes noon  xmas shopping for myself at the dispensary on my phone  and watching my stonks up and down  who says 2020 sucks
Power or sour today
damn nio why do you have to do this to me?   &amp;#x200B;  and on xmas   !
who the f selling baba
was just thinking about buying puts on BABA..just wanted to wait an hour now its gone!
Right there with you my fellow *investor*.
It’s so disappointing. I’ve lost 6k this year. I have to figure out a way to inverse my myself. So tired of this stair step to the bottom...
You have a kitchen fan?
Is BABA dragging down Gyna stonks in general, TSLA up but NIO and XPEV are down
CRSR fire sale
[removed]
It's retesting 27.9 as resistance and heading lower...
So should I be ready to drop NIO?
To the moon
Hoping Cathie is buying some SQ at these prices
What’s a pinch point? 🤏
Bro I would reverse mortgage my liver to fuck Dixie D’Amelio
Mr. Santa I dont feel so good
I was thinking the same thing. Sticking around to find out.
[removed]
now its gonna moon
When shit was tanking in March. How many of you bought the dip and how many of you quit the market for a bit?
When the Grinch stole Gainsmas
I would
BABA on life support at $211
down 11k today
JEROME! JEROME! Wake up!!!
I'd set it at 212, don't wanna miss the big upside for  1%
I was having fun but now I'm not.
Jesus Christ, stopping kicking me while I’m already down, XPEV and NIO.
Just wrecked over here.
Oh shit but don’t get me started on the MRNA 177.5 12/24c he posted on Monday lmao next day MRNA was down like 10% 😂
I would wait
I have 250 bucks left thanks baba what should I get into?
I went with Jan 2022s
Anyone else wondering why the fuck they’re even playing this shit market today
Quit bag pumping. Ffs
I'm turning my phone off now
Too early to buy any BABA dip
Okay, I'll bite. Why?
I've lost $3k on this fine krimbus eve hbu
I didn’t say it was a smart idea
So ARKG dead now
too volatile?
Reverse squeeze leading up the short squeeze thru power hour?

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
semiconductors make me fully 💎erect💎
Me too. Puts and vix calls
What about 3 in a row, one good Green Day, two shit show red days?
The G*a*ME play is easily a minimum one month hold to four months, I wouldn't worry about a near future dip.  There has been plenty of well written DD, including rocket emojis, that have all basically indicated it's not a short term (one week) play.  Just my two cents on margin.
Anyone going cash gang? Or is this just a shorty red day?
Those puts ran bigly though
China basically released another wave of COVID onto BABA.
Nio and gme
Everyone add dogecoin to your portfolio 🐶🐶🐶
Officially done w/pltr I’m 1/4 and no more fucking fomo
Nio on sale ?
i will never buy an FD ever again lmao
700$
Yeah. I feel like some 1dte spy calls are the way to go even if stimmy and spending goes south. Fitute trades will buy anything, and not buying anything Friday and all weekend will have them acting like a heroin addict for their next fix Sunday night.
Alibaba
Yes
Cathie &amp; ARKG are failing me on Christmas Eve.
PSA: BABA’s IV has shot up to 50% from 35%. If you’re not expecting a short term bounce, you’ll watch your options bleed premium while it trades flat/theta decay/IV normalizes
For real. Politics has become so insanely partisan from the last decade or two. Remember in the history books when they actually worked together and collaborated? God it's so awful. I used to enjoy political thought but it's so infuriating. [Picture from 1981 to now](https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5DJ7Q5OSKM3BJITK74FTSCNLLM.png)
Present 🤚🏽
That's Tesla for you.  The IV is so high it's impossible to make money unless you scalp daily.
Anything Chinese I don't really trust, I consider it high risk. The government has too much control. Some shit out of left field and all of a sudden the company is illegal to own or something crazy.
I dipped, need to clear my mind which is worth more than some more dollhairs
Yes hello? THIC?  Yes, I would like to file a complaint about your performance today. Your ticker very clearly has an ascending aeroplane in it.. what do you mean "risk"  Don't you hang up on me bi
The AMAZON of China is being treated like a penny stock just wow!
This NIO drop is absolute bullshit
Isn't that prices in though? It's not secret that the market closed early on Christmas Eve
PDD is the sole winner today
Yes im 🐻🔫🔫🔫
F
Bro ok all jokes aside   I don’t wish what happen to baba$ to anybody   Now it’s not even funny anymore dude   Wtf man   That’s shit is suppose to be a bluechip bruh
Me thinks that this is the bottom for baba.
Today’s redder than my girls period blood
I know it’s retarded to theorize anything on BABA at this point but someone answer me this: BABA was -8% down in Hong Kong and now we’re down double that amount(and counting). If the CCP is truly this child eating monster shouldn’t the natives have sold the fuck out?
yeah 3 day rule and all that but i couldnt wait.  worst case i avg down more later.
time to put the phone down and enjoy the holidays
Shyt, it better. Just BTD into a $45C.
Bought GME fd’s, somebody hold me
"this year"
If this has been a horrible week, you don’t want to stay around
The Cohen report of shares is going to be fire!
I feel like people aren't going to buy Lulu to workout at home.  It's a status thing.  They'll put on their nicest stuff for IG but doubt they're buying more at the moment.
Make crm great again
Well boys. Im in BABA now.
For shares and leaps, yes. Just don't go all in or anything.
Alright Tesla, let’s see that second leg up to 670 now
Wish I bought PUTS yesterday
Baba taking a big fat dump. Anyone buying the dip yet?
power hour is gonna be fun.
Imagine losing money the year that QQQ gains 40%... just throw darts at a board next time
BABA dragging down Chinese stocks across the board.
Wake me up when it’s 2021
Merry Christmas/Happy Holidays to all retards and autists. 🎄 🎅
Alright well I bought every dip and jumped into pltr and plug, I have done my part, merry Christmas everyone
Bro, really?!?
Tell me why i shouldn't just buy weeklies on baba
Stop sell you fucktards. You already bout your Christmas presents.
Thanks for the BABA dip

I just woke up because one of my low trigger got triggered. Wtf is going on
Why a loss? Did you buy options?
Anything new?
way to ruin christmas. not a good day for my meme portfolio
germany caught the new coronavirus
Look at the chart, what do you think?
 It's still not enough.
Which one of you retards is paper handing GME? STOP FUCKING SELLING.
Come on give us a proper dump. This is getting old. If every side is losing what’s the point of “playing”?
lol head and shoulders on ARKG. My positions are dead
Good on you for cashing out. Take that profit.
Jumped on AIRT too late
woah what happened with the bee
Congratulations if you bought the BABA dip, you played yourself
[removed]
ARK just went GUH from their baba holding
A SWORD DAY, A RED DAY, ERE THE SUN RISES!!!! DEATTHHHHHHH   DEATHHHHHH DEATHHHHHH
they should’ve closed the markets today lol
How far out? May or further?
Sure, If that’ll help you sleep at night.
Not worth making a post but I lost $700
no brainer yes
i am straight up not shaving a good time
What does FD stand for? Fucking dumbass?
What's the 3 day rule?
$5,500
Bleed with me king
damn why are institutional traders fucking with CRSR. like wtf did it ever do to them. its such a good company.
Xi tanked every Chinese stock today to prove a point...hope it was worth all those billions.  Fucking commie idiots.
if arkg and f could not be bitch titties that would be great
Blackberry will be reincarnated, lol
lol shorting GME yesterday was the freest money of the week.  sorry bulls
So China is dead set on destroying it mot value asset to challenge the big four in the the West. Smart
You're not allowed to sell or Huawei AI marks you with a red frowny face

Big rebound on BABA now, get in now retards
Yeah
Only my second red day of December so far so overall still doing fine lol
Just a real good butt fucking to start off the holiday season....
To Valhalla or the bread line

Why nvda dump
Day before holidays is looking like they  print Palintir puts
That's a good idea. We'll see what happens. Zm has retarded strength potential so I wouldnt be surprised if it moons for no reason
I speak with zero authority or special knowledge but I would be watching any Chinese company closely.  The market requires respect for private property and China laughs and laughs and laughs at the concept.
I really want some NKLA puts but I keep thinking it'll tread water for all of 2021.
Are you feeling it now Mr. Krabs?
Baba fucking up my jd profits today.
Im feeling unwell
might be a good day to play the sin wave...you should be up a decent amount rn. maybe sell and wait for it to drop again, then buy back.
Me tio
No. Today 1 million shorts had to cover. We are at 4 million volume. Rest of the day is red and if we are lucky back to flat EOD.
Someone turn on the 🖨️
Bought BABA dip from 280 all the way down, is this what Alibaba intelligence feel like?
Kind of a red day for me boys
Shorts trynna cover lol
The crush was extremely rapid from 10:30 EST til now. Much more than I'm used to.
Alright looks like I'm keeping my gme shares another week
guh    travel, financials, retail getting killed
BABA is on the rebound!
Blood red for me today. See you guys on Monday. Im out
Oh another dip to be bought up 🙄
Christmas ruined
PLTR: When the Dip Keeps on Dipping  A Christmas Story
xx
just bought NKLA calls....wish me luck
So many newbies in here who don’t realize when an Xmas sell off is this bad the post Xmas/January bull run is really awesome. I wouldn’t sell, but you can if you want someone’s going to buy the dip and everything will gap up so it don’t matter
Aids
Are chinese stocks a systemic risk for the rest of the market?
Or a great chance to load up?
Net positive on these DASH puts 😎
What do you mean?
Why would anyone buy options if they weren't expecting a short term bounce
enjoy this one win bears
Raise your hand if you bought ARKG after it 3x'd and expected it to keep going
I have 364 days left I ain’t worried lmfao
[deleted]
I doubt that the CCP cares about a bit of market cap in the NYSE. It's mostly just Americans buying and selling to each other anyway.
Bought the GME dip but the wrong dip i see. 😐
lmaoo safe haven

You play short? It'll bounce back long term
Welcome to communist china, BABA now needs to pay CCP tax to move forward.
Everything on sale
Why did I get spy puts yesterday, literally eveything else was free money
I'd like to meat jensen huang so I can spit in his fucking face for wasting my time.
Nothin better than dudes u know who have no idea what they’re doing putting random price targets on SPAC’s when they barely know what it is
Xi bought BABA weekly puts
😢
How many of u dumbies have options expiring today but don't realize markets close in 90 minutes? Don't let the early close cuck you!
Do you think Winnie Da Poo lubed up Jack’s asshole and is giving him a reach around or just giving it to him dry right now?  Puts on Jack Ma’s asshole.
CCP and Premier Xi to BABA holders.............. He steps in the single door. Gets his ass whipped with 20 lashes. Like that dude up in Singapore So Imma pull a fuckin Jeffrey Dahmer. Now I’m suicidal, just like Nirvana!!!!!!!
How’s it gonna spread when borders are closed from the US. The new covid is just fear mongering and who cares the europoors can dump all they want. That’s all they do anyways
It’s a victim of its own success at this point.  The amount of money in near term options literally went up over 10x this week and (surprise) most of that is in calls.  I’m now a conspiracy theorist but I absolutely believe people writing calls to make money will do whatever they can to keep options from being too painful on them and would sell shares to cause a bit of panic, might not work on a trillion dollar company but when you’re talking a few billy I believe they have influence.  Or I dunno maybe being up 50% in a week it’s not uncommon to have a red day here and there.  Regardless I’m not fucking leaving.
F I I I

Monday market follows the Chinese market. The rest of the week HK follows us. It's retarded.

You shouldn’t even be allowed to take a shower until 1:30 when you actually need to do something!  This dude has no job and pays no rent. Lmfao
Anything from china is never a bluechip lol
cringe
OK **NOW** I'm fully loaded on these CRM $227.50 90 min to expiration calls. Ready for blastoff!
So many dips today can’t even decide which one to buy.
Every stock is hurting everyone right now. Large sell off.
Stop the count!

It's a stonk

Getting some nice capital loss deduction by selling BABA. Don't know why China would do this to itself but 🤷
Sold TSLA calls. Bought 31Dec 370 SPY calls at 1.74
 This was when I first joined wsb lol
I have 100 shares of BABA for the upcoming pump and dump
Positions?
Nio on sale today if you not in yet
What’s the play to sell EOD
Yessir
I think I’m immune to the beer flu. I accidentally coughed on a couple of workers 2 weeks ago and they’re still coming to work. Nothing to worry about.
Can’t believe the $BABA calls I bought at open are still up 10% somehow 😂
I sold TSLA for ARKG yesterday 🤡🤡🤡
Went from up 5% to down 2% in about 5 minutes.  Guess Santa crashed on his way from the North Pole
lmao 2days market isnt even close to that level bud
I'm loading up on BABA expecting a bounce on Monday. Wish me luck boys.
Gut feel Monday gonna be a ripper
☠🐱📈📉
The price I think it's going to hit is actually a tad below 210 but whatever, if it doesn't hit then oh well. Not putting a big amount into it anyway.
Boutta return some Christmas gifts.
Worthless showing without account value
Weeklies puts good idea
🎵I'm dreaming of a green Christmas🎵
Most likely just getting hit cuz of BABA, china sell off
Hope you're right. Holding on hope for GME in 2021
SPY going red on Christmas is illegal
its not down even 1.5% lol
“The COVID-19 vaccine developed by China's Sinovac has an efficacy that clears the 50% level needed for approving emergency use in Brazil, according to a biological research institute in Sao Paulo state.  Sinovac has asked Brazil not to disclose the full results of trials of the so-called Coronavac for 15 days, according to the Instituto Butantan, which is overseeing the trials.  The Brazilian newspaper Folha de S. Paulo earlier reported the Coronavac had shown an efficacy greater than 50% in stage-three trials.”  Source[source](https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Coronavirus/Coronavirus-Free-to-read/Coronavirus-latest-China-and-Indonesia-ban-travel-from-UK)   https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Coronavirus/Coronavirus-Free-to-read/Coronavirus-latest-China-and-Indonesia-ban-travel-from-UK  "I'm worried that perhaps the efficacy rate is not so high after all," Dias said.

Not looking good for this one...
No problem, get out before the next leg up, though. 😊
It’s a Christmas gift. Time to buy
10% red day yaaaayyyy
Destroying shareholder value doesn't mean destroying the company.
This BABA segment on CNBC was actually very insightful.
Just buy calls
ARK funds are down about 1-2%. Why is everybody jumping out of windows?
Some guy bought in at $21.80 yesterday, but we’ll all be laughing when it’s at $25 next month... ^^^maybe
BABA copying the american V shaped recovery ... Gyna for life
Fuck it. I'm taking these losses with me into 2021
Pinduoduo time, baba over
Hope u drop it soon, cause next week is gonna be a bloodbath
Is this bottom for baba?
ppl realized no DA
Market will close in 90min so
Low volume right now
214 here we come!!!
Why is ark dumping
Chewy 621k IG followers. Barkbox 1.7million. Nough said. STIC 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
stocks are acting like its the roaring 20s  meanwhile 20% of americans are out of work and congress can barely pass $2k/person.  I am sure this will end well
Baba go down you turd
Looking at the screen like Clark griswald..  Guess I'll return those presents now
Which large institution is invested in BABA? This might be the next Lehman moment.
yo tell me when its time to buy icln and ark leaps on the dip
This is the worst fucking green day I’ve seen in a while
BABA makes $. $ wins in the end. I think this is more lip service to look powerful. The government loves BABA's success, they don't want to ruin it.
Went cash monday except TSLA. Really liking these pullbacks. You know top performing wallstreet chads dont have to trade on Christmas. They got their bonuses in the bag.
Products equal overheads. Hype equals liquid tendies. This is the way. /s

Baba on the comeback trail...buy the dip retards
Small brains not realizing that reverse mortgage my liver means I donate my liver when I die. Lmfao
Can somebody tell me I’ll be alright with my GOEV bags please ? 🥺
If you don’t buy baba right now I promise your missing out
Dw brother!!! Everything is red rn. Next week we get tendies
I don't even get it man... I think they just have a hate boner🤡🤡🤡
No way. Even if it is, the juice is not worth the squeeze.
Yeah. I bought these BABA shares for Christmas. They don’t fit. Can I get a refund?
It seems most stocks today are fucked. It’s just a Christmas week sell off. Only stock in my portfolio positive just barely is apple
Another reason I moved the fuck out at 18
Never actually played BABA before so that’ll be interesting
Good dip to buy

Berenburg Bank just raises FedEx price target today; and FDX is at low; no way it doesn’t go back up soon right?
Lmao this guy bought puts at the bottom 🤣🤣🤣
Probably cause there's not a lot of buyers and IV is higher now
just bought 220c for next week will average down if it dips to 200
Us tsla boys chillin😎😎
Because this is WSB. I had zero rationale.
Fuck no I ain’t selling either.   I’m holding that shit for a few years and riding that bitch to Valhalla!!
I’m so glad the market closes in an hour and a half so I don’t have to lose anymore money
Going to buy SQ because it’s low. That’s my TA.
Been trading for a few years and rarely shaken up by some of the big moves but I gotta say... this BABA action pretty unreal
🥱🥱🥱
Your bro is selling calls that your dad is buying
Cathie pleas fly again
Yes
Feels like we just sell off for the day. Who wants to hold over a long weekend with a lot of potential bad news. But I suppose same could be said the other way. Idk I guess I’ll just take a double cheeseburger.

Imagine trusting China 😂
I shorted it near 22 tho so I'm up nearly 20%
Shouldn’t all Chinese stocks be plummeting? This shows the government hates growth and will come after them next. NIO, and other companies are all connected to the big ones like Tenecet, BABA and Ant group.

Sold my baba last year because I'm a Morey man for life and Joe Tsai can go fuck himself, good to see that my money finally caught up to my morals. It was painful seeing all those missed gains.
With the clouds of CCP antitrust hanging over it? You do you, but I wouldn't try to catch that falling knife.
It's in a range, and will likely tap the lower bounds before heading higher.  For me, if it taps lower and starts to bounce up, I'll add.  I opened a partial position a few days ago.     [https://imgur.com/a/8Bd9PCw](https://imgur.com/a/8Bd9PCw)

Baba has been the closest Chinese company resembling a western company possibly ever.   I guess china had enough of their coddling up to the west bullshit and not going by the CCP demands.  Don't invest in China ever. Looking at you, NIO bulls

Agreed , but im holding my calls until they crash. I'm not falling for this.

I post a lot of retarded shit here but in light of Christmas:  If you’re feeling down on yourself or unappreciated, know that markets are inefficient. Be grateful for the people in your life who are there for you, and fade those that aren’t. Keep working towards whatever it is you’re doing and when the day comes when you shred “earnings estimates” watch as all of a sudden everyone wants to be associated with you and your stock price goes to the moon. Your intrinsic value is hung like Hulk. Keep at it. Merry Christmas
Harry Potter?

Where's the dipshit that has been pushing a pennystock with a ticker similarly close to PTON (take out the O). It's down almost 20% today.  (I know his username, it's u/x2Arawnage, I just want him publicly shamed and banned)
What is surprising about that lol
I know you guys have GME weeklies now post that lost porn pussy !!

Why is BABA delta always less than theta
April Mt calls taking a dump...time to eat them up
They had their anchor from Asia on and she stated that even China’s own state media is trying to bring calm to this situation, that this is because Jack Ma went too far with his criticism of regulation and the regulators are just trying to foster competition and growth for smaller companies. This is in no way to break up BABA or cripple their business because China wants a big player in the world market the way US has Apple, MSFT, Google, etc
Tsla looking like that struggle tree in Charles brown in my account right now
Currently down over $50k today. Not having a great time but it could be worse I guess
How do people get out of cheap covered calls when on Margin?  Putting new cash in doesn't let you buy options right away and will probably just lessen margin that give you funds to buy out options anyway.  It sucks being stuck in a 100 share position that only costs under $50 (with profit) to release.  Is it hard to get Naked options clearance from TDA?
QQQJ leaps are free money
Who the fuvk cares. At this point it’s moot until they sign the papers.

🤣
Just got off the phone with a BABA investor.  Their initial findings suggest that the earth's core is made from nacho cheese. More to come soon as the dip continues.
So people selling China stocks because of Xi and jack ma having problems? Yea that’s a logical way to trade lmfao. Every company including baba sucks Xi’s dick. Baba shouldn’t even be overselling because jack nana being in trouble doesn’t mean shit for the companies getting oversold. Y’all are all just really that stupid aren’t you lol?
What dip did you buy?
If this is a sell off I can't wait for the bull run.
There it is like clockwork dip is bought. Do bulls not want proper prices?

You’re totally right, I was just concerned I’d be hit with a rug pull and forced to diamond hands all weekend so I sold out. What this proves yet again is that buying cloudflare calls on its dip days is the move basically every time.
Yeah maybe don’t buy the baba dip. We are coming up on CNY and could absolutely see an extended CNY is the vaccine they are using is not effective enough.

nice, bought a little more at $212 but now gonna wait another day or 2
They’re further out. I still believe $BABA is going to retest the ATH once there’s some clarity on this overblown situation.  BABA C 19FEB21 310  Bought at open for $0.80 per contract average.
So, govt shutdown on Mon? Pretty bullish
Ya know, I miss that limit up limit down days

baba dumping 17% when in hk it was only down 8%. defnitely unexpected.
NVTA having a bad day, lot of their smaller holdings too
This is it. Baba bottom is in.
We wish you a Merry Christmas and No Money Next Year...
Next week
I'm giving it a few more days to deal with the shock of this drop.  I'm betting that the news and the market reaction will scare off a few more longs.  But overall, yeah, I agree, this will bounce back.
Looks like a red Christmas for me
Same bro, chasing pennies here...
This is where we excel
i thought she bought baidu, not baba.  Anyways wtf the only green in my portfolio was ark and now that's down too
probably some institutions trying to get out before year close. they have almost all the float.
Palantears 😢
Everything selling off because people want money for Christmas.
Via con Dios!!!
Basically, she’s saying dont overreact. Situation is not going to be worst case scenario the way people are reacting. It will be resolved with some new rule that will foster growth and competition for smaller players (which China’s been trying to do anyway for the past few years). BABA, TEN and other big players will continue their path to greatness because China wants their own Apple, Google, MSFT in the world stage
How do we see which stocks ARK is buying/selling?
Profits before new year.  I think all the stocks that have had large runups are being sold off in high volumes.  I didn't get the memo unfortunately.
What re the requirements to receive the proposed 2k stimulus?
[removed]
techincals never mattered.
Time to buy
Buy the dip f****t!!
Plan is to lock in profits on overvalued meme stonks to buy more baba if it dips
I truly believe 90% of the people in here are genuinely retarded. You guys have to be with how irresponsible you all are. Hopping on the FOMO train inflating the price of so many unprofitable meme stocks. Yolo'ing entire portfolios. And then to act with disbelief when you blow up your entire account. Jesus....      This shit sure is entertaining though. Especially when the stupid plays end up working out. Merry Christmas you stupid motherfuckers. 🎅🎄

Yep, would have been a nice 40k profit about now…
So are we getting that $600 or nah?
Bough
None, we’re just waiting for DA and it rocketed way too much yesterday. Should be $13-14 right now, not $17.
wait till eod.
No
Yeah, but they do market orders and can sell way below actual value, so I can't imagine that wouldn't sell at 3:50 if it was ITM. That's legit free money for MMs.
buy the ai dip?
nice!  This is the strongest GME performance it's had this year,  it typically gives up a ton of its gains after a crazy day. Encouraging for bull in the short term
CCP can disappear ceos though...

Thats the rest of my buying power on GME $30 1-15. LETS GET IT
i was thinking they were just collecting shares but they should be done with that by now. i follow crsr everyday so i thought it was about time the institutional buys were done, they sell to drive price down so they can keep accumulating. rinse and repeat.
Luckin Coffee nods in agreement.
Owning a few long dated calls is the only $2000 stimulus anyone is getting.

I think this also has to do with the questioning of the Chinese vaccine sinovac and the approach of CNY. If the vaccine is not effecting manufacturing after CNY is fucked. I work in manufacturing and am rushing all of my shipments out prior to CNY.

It doesn't protect against it as much as selling the opposite side, but your short leg will lose value to IV crush at a higher rate than your long leg.   I'd sell put credits personally here, though.

https://stockanalysis.com/ipos/2020-list/  Looking back on 2020 IPO's is kind of insane. If you just blindly bought every IPO without any research you would be up massively overall.  Also, seems like there might be value in Feb IPO's that got dicked over by the crash and haven't recovered?
You think santa just gonna.shovel coal and not give any out to degenerates?
Top until next week 😉
Wendy’s never slouches!
Everywhere I look in my portfolio I see red. Even these boomer T shares I don't remember buying are bleeding. And yet SPY is still green.   Perhaps I'm not very good at this.
Baba calls could be the fucking play... or not 😬
Still up 9% in a week
STOP THE COUNT
I feel like I'm playing Texas Hold 'Em and waiting on the sole river card that can save my ass.   Except that card is PLTR and it's not happening.
Same here. I didn't go in with much so I am not too worried
GME just playing with us right now, it will start to moon towards the end of trading hours
Sorry to tell you this,  but these breakup valuation wins might work in the western world but definitely not in China.
PLTR is just a big disappointment today... My calls are slowly bleeding to $0
Decided I wasn’t going to buy anything today - ended up buying loads.
Yo fuck Christmas man I wanted presents today
The amount of starving people I could have fed for the holidays with all the money I just pissed away is astounding 🤮
2021 Year of the Chinese flexing their tech companies.

This low volume is so gay. Almost like normal people are spending time with their families on Christmas instead of trading 😔

Things will be fine by Monday... chill. End of year sell off.
You wanna trade on Xmas eve bro? I like early close.  Speeds the day up
I bought BABA at $305. I don't feel anything anymore
Lol for real. I’m still bag holding tons of stuff. Capital all tied up. May have to do some Xmas triage
Nose diving - **down less than 2%**
but you have to use paper anyway to dry off your wet asshole
Tsla 0tde puts so tempting. If this shit drops 2% it’s a 10bagger
I feel your pain. I'm heavily invested in NIO and thought I was buying another dip today but it just keeps going down.
Ok, I didn't get it :) The "!!” were excessive
Wondering if I have to buy using someone else’s account to trick the market into going up
Local top? 🙏
They’re both autistic
Don’t they own like 10% of the market cap in their holdings right now
For sure I’m definitely not planning on holding until April and June, just enough to get some money back on a bounce then get out. I don’t trust this long term at all 😂
CRM calls 90mte
Tempting but ive seen this movie before, i know how it ends. Waiting a week
Is there a way to find out what Ark is doing with BABA EOD?
It’s only down 1% tho, what price?
If this is something that should happen in the next few weeks shouldn’t i wait for it to sell off again before I buy in?
Ok WSB just bought 12/31 BABA 250c... 🙏🙏🙏🙏 pleas tell me I’ll fly again
anti trust on baba
Marvel gonna catch up to amd

Anyone else think this baba dip was a tad exaggerated

They don’t care.  They all got paid a high salary, ample vacation, and top tier healthcare.  Even if they do “care” they will only fight if it doesn’t hurt them.  Tie their pay to avg salaries of citizens/living wage and I promise they address inequality.  Give them the same insurance as the average joe and they will reform healthcare.  We live in a nation that could address many of its pressing problems, but we simply choose not to do so.
grabbed some PLTR $28C 12/31 on the dip
Who else is waiting for the inevitable news about Jack Ma "disappearing"?

I just went to r/investing and I am about to have a stroke from the retardation I just read.  JFC I thought you guys were retards but r/investing denizens are another breed of human.
longer the tail the bigger the breakout. i bet Nio is going to pop after the holidays as well
FCEL is the only real dip you should be buying today. The batteries are going to fly all of January
They always are.
Ahh right.  Well ill keep that in mind lol
Baba leaps bought yesterday down 41% already. Does it hurt yes but a full year to get them gains is what’s not making me long $ROPE
If you think CCP is actually going to blow up BABA idk what to tell you. They are sabre rattling to get Ma to fall in line.  This is a good buying opportunity.
i need FUBO to do that thing where it stops crashing and goes in the other direction
Should I buy BABA rn?
ARKK dumping too GUH
Whats this?  Another gift from the ever beautiful Lady Cathrine Woods!  ARKO the last to add to our collection.  #ARKOMGYOUSHOULDNTHAVE
how low will ARKK &amp; ARKG go? wanted to buy them for a while but they always go up!
Love ABNB's premiums on calls. The thing pays for itself.
I think Cathy ark took the day off.

You can't put your finger in the dyke to stop the flood...
Pinky promise?
Move my wife's money there, woman lead funds and it goes down. Bought at the top of course.
I’m just saying, if a million autists buying the dip on BABA isn’t making it go up, maybe it isn’t a good trade. Have you heard a single person say they are buying puts?
The dip buying opportunity will be glorious
Too late. Bought some because one of you degenerates told me to buy yesterday.
My long call is taking a beating
Yes. I want 24/7 trading
GME 12/31 $23c, why did i put myself in this position.
eh gud point but  i doubt even pooh and his gang are gonna waste jack just cause he wouldnt get on his knees
my portfolio is hedged with a boatload of UUP calls. if the market crashes i'll make money. if the market doesn't crash i'll make money.  think about it.

No reason whatsoever for NIO to be down. It will close 47+
Probably will end slightly red today
It's called Alibaba Intelligence, not Ma Intelligence.
Bought a handful of NET 12/24 $83c yesterday at $0.80 and sold 10 minutes after open. Merry Christmas to me!
Low IV for XPEV, only 66%.

Cuz someone's been a bad boy.
holy fuck i just bought an AMZN 3200c 1/29/21 and it cost my left nut.
Less goo. Just curious, why sell the 20% if you think it will moon?
For the guy who said to go balls deep in NET calls yesterday when it dipped, thanks.
Cathie I don’t feel so good
Pltr not dropping now 27 today. 27 strike puts are free today
Wait isn't it though 🤔
Power hour for PLTR coming up. Gonna end day flat
Man pltr premium is low right now. Almost makes me want to buy calls for next week but I've already been losing all my profits on this stock
How long should I keep a FCEL call for? And what should be the limit price? And how many contracts?

Same thing happened last time and baba kept dumping
Let’s goooo BABITCH
This has huge implications in manufacturing. If the vaccine widely being used in China is not effective it could reasonably trigger a delay in opening after Chinese New Year. Any real delay will cause delays across all spring shipments in retail... hard to keep the economy up and running if there is no product to sell.
Santa rally cancelled, New Years rally still very much on
Buying BABA right now on the dip “be greedy when others are fearful...”
Just buy and then average down but sub 100 for ARKG would be good.
He hasn't transitioned like Elon and Bezos yet. Those dudes were goofy looking then changed with piles of cash. Bezos when he founded Amazon looked like an average dad and now he looks like an MMA fighter.
Am I not meant to? Also, "had" 2k. Should I just sell everything and restart again?
Yes
imagine not listening to daddy elon...  that's top level retarded
SAD!
Goooo EV! 🤡
What are we thinking about GME right now?
Now go buy another one, no balls
Merry Christmas, Retards🚀❣️🚀
Ban
It happened before. I remember, sometime in summer. Turned to be nothingburger, and good buying opportunity
I need that certainty.
OMG I thought I was buying a BABA call on the dip but I ended up with a BA call!  🤡😂🤡😂
Alright bois, it’s a Christmas sale today. Which means tendies next year. Which sales should I buy?
Christmas money plus stimmy checks, bulls are gonna have a field day

Fuck you and a merry christmas to you too!  I‘ll have some more PLTR calls for you next week if you are interested :D

I made some quick money on puts this am
People, every stock is down today or trading lower. Don’t be a 🐻🌈 have 🙌💎 instead. Recovery Monday.
Fuck it, bought the BABA dip. Can't go tits up.
Winnie Da Poo is waving back at you right now
Just hold if they're longer exp palantir will make a move soon imo
Today boring af.  Just bleeding everywhere.  Chalk up another w for the fookin theta gang

Some of you will be alone on Christmas, and some of you will have lost a good amount today, but mostly it’s going to be both.  Stay strong lads, good times ahead! Focus on your health and well being. It’s just paper.

Arkg July itm leap. Paper handsed it yesterday morning on the dip. Took a solid $500 profit and waiting to get back in cheaper.
What’d he say?
Brexit trade deal.
Wow I just looked at Baba lol... tbh this looks like a buying opportunity. Baba still the e-commerce king in China. This is just like when they bring in FANG for their quarterly media harassment. Always bounces back
Small caps? Maybe?
Absolutely an overreaction. What incentive does the CCP have in ruining their most prosperous company? This overreaction to political theater is a huge opportunity for anyone with cash right now.
Just got into ICLN 4/16 32 C. Feel like this is a rather stable stock and can weather some hard shit the market gonna throw at it

Welp I’m taking off went -15% this week, gonna enjoy the holidays with my family see y’all Sunday night for futes 🤠
Whoever said yesterday at close to buy OTM TSLA FDs, THANK YOU!
I would load up during this dip on ARKK
I've been holding the calls for a while now. I just wish pltr hit 30 so I could break even and get out.
\[i am very happy that pltr is going on sale rn\]
Dow is for boomers.
If it somehow drops below 100 for ARKG buy that shit asap
Anything running right now?
QS ain’t done running. All stocks take breathers and have mini corrections on the way up to shake out the paper handed bitches
And it’s gone
Bought the FUBO dip. Am I retarded?
Anyone else eyeballing AFRM
Thank you based Elon

But they aren't sleeping on MT/steel plays though.
Nice poem poetryboy
Palantir took two days to reach that level of 29 and in the space of 15 minutes it lost it all, lolllll
Selling puts on this is profitable if you sell around 26-27
You say that, but nasdaq is even :p
Fuck are you spying on me?
Don't buy BABA options, the IV crush on Monday will rape you, violently.
Long BABA and Short GME...you must really love the soup kitchens
👆
LIDAR...so hot right now
At least China is actually doing something about its tech monopolies. Our anti-trust processes won't achieve anything
Wait 3 days before buying the dip on big news like this for an individual stock
I'm delighted to announce that I will be BTFD on CRSR
nows your chance, i think ill add here
What time is the algo drop scheduled today? We still got 1hr 15 m
no its not like the FANG situation at all.  China is not the US. not by a longshot.
what if the real gains we made were the laughs along our journey? 😌
Wth is happening rn?
Time to avg down
Stop buying Tesla you fucks
It will print
yes. if the CCP were going to blow up BABA they wouldn't draw it out. They'd just do it .
NP looks too good of an opportunity to pass up, barely ran yet too still early
Good time to buy ARKG
Next Friday is New Year 2021! time flies! 🍾🎉
Look at FCEL in 2000.  Do you know what FCEL does?  Check their revenue and profit.  It is a dog shit company
Hop on SSPK before  its too late valued at 400m but I'm smelling a multi billion buyout from a big cannabis player come 2021.

20.69. Already had quite a few before the buy so it only brought my cost basis up a little bit.
Same here.  Everything I'm short is up, everything I'm long is down.  Payback because everything has been working too well.
Why so optimistic?
What is airt? ???
BABA green EOD
Wish I had a stimmy check to throw at it
not 100 for a round lot? at least you'd be able to write covered calls against the position for a while.   90 is like 🤡🔫
Exactly. Or passed out and woke up with a dick drawn on your face. You just opened up your account and feel like you should have one.
SMART! If senate goes blue in a few weeks, this is a 5% gainer instantly
have been waiting for this to happen. I hope it goes down to 90  so that I can buy some
BABA rising.
why do people insist on chinese stocks when we got all these delicious fucken US stocks at home
not yet
Don’t worry when I get mine I’ll buy you a 4 for 4

BABA was down only -8% in Hong Kong but it's fucking down -20% here in America.

Wouldn't you first have to have a competitive market for antitrust to be relevant lol
Only reason it hasn’t is TSLA lol
You mean 0 to infinity
When the only green things in my portfolio are SPY and QQQ... what
Why would there be an IV crush Monday..
Naturally I sell my 0dte tesla calls for a little bit of profit and it goes back up $5 two minutes after I sell. 🙄
Looking at BABA dragging down my portfolio...  “Alexa play Not Afraid by Eminem”
FEYE about to do that thing again.
It's already been dropping

The prophecy has been foretold!
I think we just got fucked. There goes the profit I made riding this up.
Think about it  $BABA is Amazon of China with more 10+ times customers population
NASDAQ still green too.
-3.12%
Good idea. Might want to roll out further though.
366 or lower at close
Thinking about buying this SQ dip. Would i be fuk?
Market closes early today.
Lol maybe 100. Not 90
No BABA?
real talk the smart play is to not play BABA at all. too news driven.
Why is fubo tanking
Please. Fucking. FLY!!!!!
4. WuFlu
Green deal my friend green deal
Of course it's still massively down. We haven't recovered yet and we're far from it. That's why you can still buy airlines at 50% off pre-covid levels. The idea is to buy low and then sell high, remember?
Jesus. Even MGNI is taking a day off.
Same, this hurts. I just want it to hit 30 once so I can break even and gtfo.
BABA is a National Champion
Power hour is about to be sexy today
Imagine buying calls in a company that just announced they are under investigation
Nah
Before you know it, so probably now heh
Well shit. I should have asked for 8 days of gains then.

Freakin WMT.  Will never do options of this POS again
Why EOD?

Look at BLNK. That was riding around the 20-30 range for a while and then broke out and within a week it hit 52 where its at now.
hope you bought the dip
China hate is real in US, btfd anyways
Buy the AI dip
Literally everything red except almost GME. What a stupid day

Okay, as long as we don’t lose more money I think we’re good....
It just goes down by $5 for every $100 you make above the $70k (single) threshold. It's higher if you're married or have kids.

Fuck those dinosaurs
Cmom Trump say some stupid shit on twitter again
Stimulus news ping pong cost me 3x 2K stimulus and 10x $600 stimulus in 2 days.  Bought back into SQ at strong support with a ton of momentum and NIO day coming.  Let the bodies hit the floor
Don’t think you know how IV works
Already got 10K of PLTR. Thanks for reassure
V shaped recovery BABA

No fucking Volume whatsoever. Don't even know why I wasted my time checking the market.
Historically what happens between Christmas and new years? Buy season or tendie season?
Way overvalued in comparison
I think you might be a little too optimistic on this. Financials &lt; CCP.   A great case study would be Tencent. Again one of the largest companies but pinned in the past as out of control youth gaming did not fit into the narrative.
every decent SPAC's warrants are trading above $2, with no targets and deadline for two years. hahaha
do you hedge leap, synthetic equity, ? just learning leaps
The Krampus dick-drilling of ‘20. It hurts.

Good stocks to buy on the dip today?

When the economy is on the brink of collapse, safest place to store your money is in mattresses.   Guess that's why PRPL is up 8%.
remindme! 7 days
It’s just market fear
Under investigation in China = not under investigation in China
BREAKING: Jack ma seen in Xinjiang camp learning basket weaving says CCP is the greatest.
I said a competitive market, not competition
If you’re not getting in on BABA now... you really do have a smooth brain
Calls
Honestly, I'm thinking about taking some off the table. This Tidal acquisition sounds dumb af to me and looks like they have more money than ideas. They should be spending time building products and markets that actually fit their core offering.
Hell yeah. That seems fair.
y'all about see a repeat of this monday happening again... the uk flu is gonna go crazy in europe
I'm getting assblasted by ebay, damn
I hope you sold man
Nobody really wants to authorize a trillion plus USD debt package right now when a new admin is coming to power in a month, it’s all bluster.  You’ll see back and forth and then a week after we have President Biden we’ll get (more or less) the same package President Trump nixed.  None of these people actually feel any of the pain that any American who is in the bottom 95% has felt this last year, all they’re worried about is optics: Republicans have to look like they fought hard to only do what was needed to keep the economy from dying, the Democrats have to look like they’re doing all they can to make the world a better place.  The more pain the people feel the more each party can tell their base “I fought for you, but the other side made this as awful as they could”.  Both parties are ass.
When you lie on your resume by saying you know how to “manage risk” knowing full well you lost $16,000 on 0dte’s in 30 minutes the day before.
GOEV is ear fucking me rn
You can just feel FCEL getting ready to break out and go wild 😈
Wow FDX bears really taking advantage of the low volume; under 1 million.
wouldn't be surprised if kodk overtakes babas mkt cap now that i capitulated
BABA 220C  pray for me.
🤦🏻‍♂️ What's with these hard rejections. Am I in middle school agan
17% drop for a 700B mkt cap company is the biggest ive ever seen. runner up was AAPl down like 10%
My SBE calls have been crushing it this week. Have calls for March and may. This will run hard when the merger with ChargePoint is complete before mid January. IMO ChargePoint will be the leader in EV charging, in tandem with the Tesla supercharger network. I say this as a Tesla owner. I just don’t think it’s on peoples radar like it will be once it’s ChargePoint and not SBE after merging. Buy the picks and shovels, not the gold!
As much amzn PLUG ARKG as possible
Stocks closed you virgin
Fuck u for the gay day spy
Making a point of it being China.  Under investigation in America is a buy catalyst, its not like that in China.

This year's Santa rally fucking sucked.

Probably something to do with being up 500% in a month
It ain’t just the gop lmao it’s everyone in the shitty Congress. I think we need to get rid of all of em and start over personally
The algos stopped following his Twitter account in mid-November.
It's not the Amazon of China. BABA doesn't have warehouses, they are basically a storefront connecting businesses to consumers.   They're more comparable to Ebay if all Ebay users were businesses and not private sellers.
I would inverse WSB about 85% of the time LOL  I only say that because I tried to short it during the squeeze after open and I didn't realize that this is a fresh ticker
What do I've to do next? Calls? Shares?

Bulls and bears are both losing. Dumps pre market recovers before open and ends flat. How are we not all banding together?
Yea you’re right.. China is going to hurt itself by bringing down one of its biggest companies.. makes sense. This is all politics and will eventually blow over. As usual this is overselling on fear. Revenue isn’t going anywhere, the company isn’t going anywhere. This is about as strong a buy that’s out there. Just don’t play short term.
Bought PLTR 29p yesterday after spending weeks throwing money at calls..  Woke up just in-time for ATH half an hour ago. Happy holidays, retards!  🚀
Thinking of flipping my ARKW to ARKK to consolidate. Thoughts? I also have ARKG, ARKF and ICLN
The tiniest of V's
Same here fellow autist.
Amazing he can weave basket with broken fingers.
LMAO the fact that I actually forgot about that. Wow.
ARKK ARKG baby

Go short on one and long on the other, call guaranteed profit.
No dumbass
Aapl with the daily pump and bleed..should close under 131
4. Fake Honey  I watched a doc about how they have a whole science lab just to test if honey is real or fake made from corn syrup in Germany. And apparently Xi, aka Winnie Da Poo eats soo much honey, China has to pump out fake honey to the rest of the world like it’s no tomorrow trying to pass it off as real.   Fuck you Winnie Da Poo! I see you! 👀
Hey did you know market closes at 1pm today
You can invest in literally any company that didn’t come out as possibly being corrupt and it would be a better option.

Historically its a 70% chance of green days over the next trading week however Stim/US Budget/COVID adds volatility this time around
0dte?
Imagine being a GME short heading into a 1pm close, with a 3 day weekend and wondering if you'll even have a place to live next week.  Let's go.
Well fuck me then
Depends on how much money you made. If you can afford to spend 500-1000 on a quality cpa, do that because they can save you taxes in ways you never imagined.
Liquidated my position for ~30% loss. Taking the rest of the year off. Could be worse right?
Glad I held off on fomoing into it
Not the best day 🤔
Everything hurts except tesla
ARKF?
“ARKG seems a bit too high” says my relatives who bought PFE @ 41
You know, there's stupid and then there's really, fucking stupid. It should be obvious that you cannot front run an economic recovery in the commodity space. Because if a bunch of boneheads bid up prices of key commodities like steel or oil, then the recovery never happens and demand stays depressed. Sell that shit and move on.
all hail Xi Jinping. no one in the US has the balls to do what he did. Big tech is too powerful lets be honest. I gained alot of respect for him srs.
SANTA CLAUSE SIGHTING. POWER HOUR HERE WE COME

Only thing I regret about today is having no extra cash to buy all these mahfackin dips baby
SPY be like: I’m gonna thetabang-bang you into the night.
Yawn. Dudes like you been telling me this shit since i got in close to the bottom over the summer. Keep telling yourself people are going to just stop flying and airlines are dead while more and more get vaxxed every day and are dying to go somewhere. I'll keep counting my profits.
Baba at pandemic price levels. This is the chance to get in before it 🚀 seriously undervalued
Ole Minecraft head looking ass
Thanks BABA for the wonderful christmas gift of losing all my money
yes we did it BABA! , only down 2,900 today. pretty happy to get under that 3k line.
You in k or g ?
Buy leaps
what should i get into right now boys
You sure about that?
I’m really interested to see what she did today.
I've been loading up. Even bought a couple of calls.  Someone has dumped 100,000s of shares. I had originally planned to be entirely out but the price on this looks insanely good to me right now.
N O T O N S W E E P S W E E E E K
BABA will still exist in China...the problem is if the Chinese government owns it...will its ADRs be delisted here.
No, but I think this is an over correction and it will see 50 again
400 or 150
A 1% off sale on SPY would be nice for Christmas.

We're STOPPING THE COUNT!!
If you didn't buy that BABA bottom you should quit trading.
lol I made a bad call because i bought 90 shares of chinese amazon on a 15% dip and only up 1% on the year.  You let me know how it works out for you when you lose your shares and this thing runs-CCs are cool until they arent

No comment
EVERYONE GET INTO BABA
Red red red red red
Fuck today
Does it look like TSLA is going to hold 660?
You holding??
Your not doing it right then. Play the morning reversal with shares and collect premiums from the dumbasses who think it will tank or spike in a week by doing covered calls and puts. PLTR is literally such easy money.
What’s inbetween a paper hand and diamond hand? Could’ve had 28k profit but came out with 19k from my Tesla calls. I was selling portions throughout the day.
We got sold a theta bag smh
Ban
u/ElonMuskOfficial now TSLA got bigger market cap than BABA. Lmao brings me back to the Alibaba Intelligence video.
BABA to 400 in 2021  MERRY CHRISTMAS
They kept markets open on Christmas Eve for big money to take profits and rug pull all the winners. Merry Christmas hedge funds, ya filthy animals

STI* needs to dip more so I am comfortable to buy.  just got in GHI* &amp; BF* hopefully they are not dipping to much.
SQ please give me a merry fucking Christmas
BABA won’t go pass 220 today
The S&amp;P should be 50% TSLA because then it’d be green right now
STIC gonna keep on climbing, Barkbox ftw
JD calls mayne
Might buy more tbh
Someone one tried to tell me North Korea’s press was as unfree as the US’s lol
Bought 5 more BABA to DCA. Thanks
Those TSLA 665 and 660 calls have been one big game of hot-potato alllll day
Aye aye captain
SPY X-mas sell off?
Baba delisted
We'll see about that. Looks like people are selling in preparation for possible shutdown on Monday. Then we'll really fall.
Sexy to btfd
I let them ride an then my short term plays with my hedges usually balances everything out but I couldn’t predict this shit was going to happen so I wasn’t set up properly
bought the BABA dip with shares and calls.  to put things in perspective BABA makes 50% MORE revenue than AMZN at 1/3 the PE ratio..... if this was an American company it be $500 easy.
Buffet called and he said buy the BABA dip f*ggot ,   Also ret*rded censorship rules at reddit, what is this Gyna?
Overreaction for baba ? Do calls for 2 weeks from now might cash in ?
hands that make money
Well chumps, its time for pumps
The retard is strong with the USA
Please sign my petition to get u/ziz into Wall Street to fix these retarded algos!

Comeon BABA, lets break that 220.  Crazy swing in options today
Probably 1/15. No 1/18 expiration lol.
Baba 300c 1/22 alright alright
i bought more ARKG at 105.9 today so I know the feels broo

Hope everyone has a merry Christmas, I’m red today so stealing presents for collateral
Mango was right, its chinese virus!! Baba killed whole mArket!
So i should double down
WSB has lost its meme power. Maybe we can pump something for a day or so but I'm not sure we will see weeks of running anymore. A month ago PLTR and NIO was making everyone stupid gains for weeks  straight
Nah I'm fucked as of today.  So pissed I didn't sell my options s yesterday when there was hope
So, those vans will be rented not sold?
Yep, confirmed MMs don't care about the holidays.

Today is fucking ridiculous- how can buyers and sellers be in such agreement.  Literally my 6 year old couldn’t trace better than the spy ticker on my iPhone stock watch chart.
i swear to god PLTR better not be RKT 2.0
Office has an Alexa. [WSBsynth.com](https://wsbsynth.com/) means that this shit just made Fall Out Boy play for real.
someone get me a medkit
The most American thing to do would be for us to drop all the BABA bags. Fuck the CCP
TSLA does not follow the market. TSLA goes up on red days and even more up on green days
If you’re not buying the CRSR dip you’re retarded.
bridgewater and 3rd point both have huge BABA positions at $230.  &amp;#x200B;  Even they are GUHing today. Cheers u/xijinping
Someone here yesterday bought a bunch of 665C that broke even at 666, and the calls are up 200% from then anyway.
You jinxed it!

It’s up.

PLTR rebound imminent
Whats best trading site for shorting stock
TSLA
What are you holding?
[deleted]
Probably bounce but I wouldn't hold the bounce.
It’s been bouncing between upper resistance and lower support trend lines the past few weeks, forming a bullish pennant, and in the next few days it’ll have to make a decision. We could see it break 29.5, 30, 31 and after that it’s clear sky’s 🚀

Nobody suggested any penny options to me so I'm going for a pair of contracts against Intel, $40 Jan 8 puts. The orders haven't filled yet so if any options writers in here want to bet against me for what you think will be an easy $2, feel free to fill that order

Do some research. Every bank is going to be using this software in the next 10 years. It’s going to revolutionize institutional lending
Ok, let's go ahead and add "santa claus rally" to the list of boomer lies.   Where's my whiskey.
He’s unbanned now
They aren't going well though.
just buying shares.. IV is too high for calls
The majority of the Santa rally normally occurs AFTER Christmas.
Looking at your calls down 90% is a religious experience.
How are the indexes green? It seems as if everyone is fucked on this holy day.
I’d buy these dips if it weren’t for the long weekend ahead
I’ve never had a single good experience with baba. Fuck man need this shit to REVERSEEEE

Invest in yourselves and give the gift of SPY 370c
BABA JAN 250C MAKE ME RICH! V SHAPE RECOVERY!
Christmas Eve margin call 🥳
Fair point. I'm up 30% on ARKW and 40% on ARKK shares so it's not a big return difference. Thanks for the input!

tsla is better hedge than spy puts
I choose to believe the only reason my account has seen so much alternating red and green this week is to be festive in the spirit of Christmas. I just need the festivities to end on green by EOD
xi jinping was upset so he made a few calls and shaved off 300B mkt cap from the biggest company in China. Let that sink in.  All hail lord Xi
Keep selling covered calls on PLTR through Jan?
That's what I'd suggest, as long as it is within your risk parameters - e.g. not making your portfolio too dependent on just this one company.
Got them too.
depends on how much money the central party members have invested in BABA and if they have  exited already.  If they haven't, this is a good plan to let the world know Xi is in charge, teach Ma his place, while also allowing party members to get a better entry point before letting the probe give him a slap on the wrist and it rebounds.
sq daddy
Finally in PLTR on this low volume dip. Let’s 🚀
Buy the dip on BABA?
Haha, I here ya. I've been cleaning everything in my house as I can't watch this massacre anymore.
I need confirmation bias that gold is gonna take a $10 haircut by Monday
You too homie
Nice!
most likely see a pump for new year positions
Hope some of y’all bought that SQ dip.
Yesterday I got in to H to izZO. Today it's my best performer. You boys need to remember why we're here, yachts! Buy yacht stock, get yacht tendies. Make this your personal power hour.

Paper handing means you would be selling. Not holding over the weekend.
I don’t look at the news. Only the charts mainly. But thanks for the info!!
Damn GME will not go below $20, bullish af

RH account looks like chaos, charlie schwab account looks so tranquil.
SQ you’re doing amazing sweetie
I have 5k worth of both. Will buy more at dips. Thanks
GME is squeezing as predicted. Just not the shorts but the wsb's balls
I’m laughing at those paper hands that sold SQ today.
Somehow only down $10 for day...
that's pretty good. kinda feels like when I bought BA last year at $330.
Bottom is in boys, back up the truck and load the fuck up
Would it be a good idea to hedge my BABA calls with one or two puts expiring next week?
you donkeys have pushed STIC up way too far to get a good entry. I guess I will have to wait until options are available and sell puts to get assigned.
shit manipulated as fuck so you got a chance
Close the fuckin market
I think it's smart until you hit the of the lockup period.
Reasons I hate China 1. China
keep this one on the low. Weedmaps is a godsend in legal states, let us build a position first.

Fucking shit mods, why did you ban the one guy posting actual winner DDs?   Jannies proving their homosexuality again.   FREE SIR JACKS A LOT.
What would they even spend the money on besides executive compensation? It's not like GME is as debt-ridden as most of the recent meme stocks.

Do I keep my TSLA 670c exp 12/31
Is lulu a good buy right now ?
Almost like being suffocated by the ass cheeks of a 400 pound woman. Its not decent, but you can still breathe. So its not all that bad.
Weeklies are like lotto ticket, man. Good thing you stopped
Yep, I sold at 28.15. Might rebuy Monday we’ll see. It’s tying up my capital when I could be in stocks that are actually moving
trump does the same thing with his tweets
It's probably not too late to get in on FRHC if you want to be a buy and hold investor instead of a wsb options gambler
So this bullish or?
Time for a Christmas miracle power hour?
Damn baba puts are like +2000 - 3000%

Every stock is in red. What a way to celebrate Christmas 🎅Ho Ho Ho, Merry Christmas!
I agree. This will be the third red week in a row. Last time it happened was in March it shot up like 19% the following week. I'm hoping for 10% increase before 1/15

RCL, BTFD???
Reddit premium is actually useless
270 -  jan 2022
Yes
I am literally pumping everything I have into baba calls at $200
Story time: Last Friday I held two FCEL 9c till expiration. I was under the impression TDA would close them automatically since I didn't have any buying power but I wake up Monday with 200 extra shares and an $1800 margin call.  I'm still holding the shares which are up 30% today. I sold half of them yesterday when it went over $13. I'm just gonna hold and see how long TDA will let me keep them. If it pops again I can sell enough ccs to cover my margin
Are markets closed early today?
Thats what I think. I sold puts on it. So if it goes down I am screwed.
HERE. WE. GO.
We all did lol
One hour to go.  Power hour or sour hour?
Okay, I’m in a 40% position right now... looking to DCA over the next few weeks. Any idea when SSPK is expected to merge? I read Q1-2 2021
Damn. Anyone here have BABA calls before today? On the other hand, anyone here have puts?
Any dips to buy at close??
COMMENCE POWER HOUR!

Don’t tell my April calls that 😉
i just woke up, wtf happened to alibaba
I just bought RKT
Go find Bezos for that
Not very Sneks today
BTFD on BABA.    It's basically a national champion for tech.  China will not break them up.  They will add regulation so Alibab opens up the 1 or 2 option to other retailers, but Alibaba will still be dominant because economies of scale.  Alibaba also has the best research in AI in China.  And AliHealth is huge.  just BTFD in stocks for your retirement fund.
You got to grab baba at 215 man  Do people really think the government is going to shut down the network that powers 45% of their exports
Friend of mine sold his BABA calls for a 35k loss.. he was even a few days ago

Alright fine business can be hard, let’s take away all the tax breaks then.  And the FED is designed to help control inflation by adjusting interest.  It’s clear you have no real idea how things work or the impact they have.    And since you run a business I’ll assume you did not take part in the Payroll Protection then right?

I'm disappointed that I bought into the hype of MT. I'll let these calls crash and burn so that I can learn a lesson and become impervious to FOMO.
Why are we red
I’d sell. I played fcel for a few weeks but never held overnight. It traded between $7 and $12 like clockwork before the last dilution. They got some good news and I’d say $14 is probably the top of the channel now. I bought late yesterday and sold at close to get out even. Or, I could be wrong and it goes up next week. I don’t have enough faith in the company to hold it.

FOR US BY OS
This sucks. German brokers are closed. I have BABA calls and stock and I can’t do shit but watch my money evaporate on Christmas Eve
Yuck
Merry Cuckmas boys
The idea that Bezos sends out dick pics is so cringe that I think the fed should take over AMZN before China takes over BABA.
BABA you fucking piece of shit get back to VWAP at least
yeah lots of options nbd
Flow in BABA is bad, ALOT of long term CALLS closing there positions, the call side not looking too great
you said you were down....
damn you can ride a canoo down that fuckin slope
This volume is gay
Little late there lol

+ buy calls with low IV  + sell calls with high IV
wtf? 77 million is not at ALL normal for SPY lol  That's like a massive selloff day
So you edit the comment to "quality issues", cool dude. If you aren't talking about his specific car stop using specific words
7% on an option?? You ain't seen nothin' yet! Glad to hear you're green though, bro.
nope
Down on the day, not overall
but festivus was yesterday
If you read my DD, you’ll see my prediction is coming right for AAWW, get on the tendie train with AAWW c/57.50 in febuary
Now we need a big power hour.
Doesn't AMZN always go up after Christmas?
Got it, all in on COKE.
Well I'm the idiot who sold some of my shares back at $132 because I thought the valuation was getting ridiculous so wtf do I know?
Making nearly two months salary this week can even put a negative fuck like me in the Christmas spirit!  Merry Christmas everyone, may the only red you see be the bow on a wreath

What are the odds of being able to buy a 2022 expiry $WISH call any time soon?
Feeling really good about my decision to swap calls for shares before the year ends. Yikes
I bought them after.  Got some nice cheap ATM Jan calls that should pay off these Christmas gifts.
Someone tell me why ICLN is a buy for 2021
guess ill try an amzn 3180c for 2.7 why not.
buy the sq dip?
Yeah, no way not up by then.  Definitely not selling shit
Welp. My 12/31 AMD calls I bought earlier aren't looking great
Im just looking at what is says on the RH spy page
Question:  i have 8 12/21 $23c on GME.  Exit position and take this loss, or is there a chance to recover some of that loss going into next week? my butthole is scorched man.
Huge fucking year   Literally the chance for 10 baggers every week  +200% on shares across the board   WSB: this market sucks what a gay Christmas
Hold on to stock bud.......it ain’t going lower. China will slap them w a fine remind Ma whose in charge.......
GME... didn’t even dip that hard, and will shoot next week or Jan
Damnit. Sinking ship now. Losing good mods and inspiring people. I want to know where they're going to.
Not even power hour gonna save me
I will. I’m in since September. 7$. I’ll be out when it’s 160$
#UPS and $170      Name a better duo. Feels like it has been stuck there for ages!

Same question but for 1/8/2021
Ive been holding shares since $77. What a ride- bought in May
Green new deal. Dem prez + house. Potential senate. If Dem actually wins senate it will shoot off to Mars
Next week will be your week. Double down and stay strong.

Come on you motherfucking GME
The shit is down pennies on the day and was up the last two days.  You could have pottery clay hands and still hold easily.  MT is not a weekly play, it's a monthly one.

BABA CALLS!
Why not?
Your comment yesterday about not going in when wsb is in stopped me from FOMO. Although, I have not professed to step 2 of finding a good spac close to Nav. I bought THBR a few weeks back that’s up but other than that I’m still trying to learn how to spot one early on before the pump
Mah Belleh! I ate a babeh! ARKG
BABA CALLS BABYYYY
dips is being bought up 🎄🎅
I love chevelle too, just not actually seeing that shit
I can live with a red day that looks like this. A day where my portfolio is down this much but SPY is still green would piss me off.
Dear VIX, u gave us Christmas in March. Now, how about Christmas in December Thanks! Your friend, Bearly Legal.
Man December really sucks fucking ass. I thought this was gonna be such a huge month after the election but nope... flatter than my sisters tits
The "Analyst" that gave FUBO the $8 price target has been barred from FINRA to act as broker or associating with a broker-dealer firm. He's trash.

PLTR
Yes! I didn't think Jack Ma would let this drag on for so long, but the fact the big boys closed their millions of dollars bullish options after todays drop is not a good sign
Fr I just saw the headline that said “stocks up...”. Which ones!? had to double check my shit because like 13/15 of mine are red lol
YOLO'ed into BABA calls
hey ma we got chicken or what?? MA!!!
Still a negative fuck on people, threw a few hundred to my local pet shelter though
Let me explain what’s going on: this year sucked for normal people and kids, they are pissed off cause they had to cancel Disney vacations this year, couldn’t go play outside and shit.   Enter Christmas and kids want something big to make up for the shitty year, they want a PS5, but we all know that the only ps5s are like 10x normal price  and since this fuckers didn’t give us our stimulus well what can you do as a dad???  Obviously sell your stocks to buy some nice presents
How old are you?
just taking advantage of this hive mind is all hahaha  It’s only a problem when the lil guys do it 🙄🙄
Been that way all week. EV and Apple pumps combined are a whole new level of meme.
I see lots of ppl here getting some NKLA &amp; LK treatment with their BABA. Literally giving away their hard earned cash to GYNA, poor shmucks
Yeah but his puts probably printed bigly lol
Idk what you’re in but I’m up bigly this montj
More than we'll end up getting from stimulus.
Fuck it going in on BABA
I'm not an alcoholic, I'm just addicted to seeing you pretty.
There’s a feeling that goes along with buying FDs. It’s not always positive. It often has fear, frustration or the sense that maybe you’ve bit off more than you can CHWY.  But doing the real thing matters. Days wasted on "investing" may keep you busy, but they never seem to go anywhere. A life spent on real risk may not always be the easiest or most stable, but it’s the one that might pay in the end.
I sold my BLNK puts too early. Lost out on $2300 of potential gains. But made $1600. So not too shabby. Off to bed 🛌 😴   BABA September 2021 285c!!! 🚀
100 shares of aapl and sell calls on it

Yeah, to his new gf while he was still with his wife.
And how does that work?
Haven't gotten out, down like $2k on the day right now but I could see it maybe ending right around 20, I expect a bump next week though once there's real volume back in it
Pleas post BABA loss porn
How is spy green? Everything is red from my watchlist lol

For all you that worship ARK, didnt they just buy BABA like two days ago?

AMZN been buying up used planes to build up a fleet and Amazon is 22% of their business. That's why Bezos stock been flat too. One of the reasons UPS didn't provide guidance. Holiday hiring numbers was out since October.
No fun. This is money. Go all in on GOEV and forget about it.
If you dont mind sickening volatility NVTA is great for swing trades

Yes let’s just sell everything
Sir I want my 2k stimi. My calls need to refuel.
Aw fuck i fucked it
No I didn’t, but business that did can still speak out against it. Everyone is going to operate in their best interest, if the government is giving out free money of course you take it to stay competitive with your peers, but you can still hold the opinion that they shouldn’t.
Which is good for smaller competitors. Long stonks

sounds good

Added BABA to my boomer IRA 👍🏻

I mean its technically tomorrow in CN...

The dip?? How do you know? It is the most random anti trust probe i've ever seen. China's financial markets are obviously way too political

*Bwadadedidlerdow*
Nah that sell off was fake af, market clearly going up Monday
PLTR super lame now.
I actually can’t recover anymore. Baba is dead and I lost my house
They are absolutely bum programs that should be eradicated, people love to talk about how wages have been stagnant since the 60s, coincidentally the same time all this big welfare started up.
what part of   Only the Rs are fighting against anything that helps the people.  don’t you understand
Well regarded
There we go
Mark my words ALIBABA WILL OPEN AT $180 Monday then gap up after to $240
I swear I’ve been doing this shit with a bunch or tickers over the past 3 months
Buy high sell low
Dump in last 30m almost guaranteed.
You have two paths you can take:  Put it all in mutual funds and safe etfs  Yolo it all on meme stock calls
Presuming people start to wean off the Covid news, I'd think that with a Dem. presidency and possible house flip, the focus will be back on climate change initiatives
Hey man, you do you 🙏
Happy cake day
Buy low, sell lower
You leaving money on the table if you dont buy spring-mid summer calls on BABA
Wow. Glad I jumped out of EBAY. Dafuq is going on with this stock, nonstop declining
Pls fly again 🦅
eh
PSTH June calls will print bigly
It will flop around from free money to worthless back and forth all week as is customary.  Just close them out when they are green and don't try to time the waves.
Does Bombardier have the opportunity to go to the moon i currently bought 4000 shares YOLO
Nio.
ICLN barely even dipped tho
Got in a couple of years ago heavy at $40. Been my best move. See you at $300!
is it safe?
People did that yesterday and now its down $40  So no
True. BABA is so undervalued though, even moreso now, that the government could take pieces and it would still be a good stock to own. Obviously depends on what they take though.
People have been killing each other since the dawn of time, thats a retarded thought to have.
Fingers crossed 🤞🏼
Bruh China soo smart 🤓🤓🤓  "Let's just devalued our largest asset while also trying to aggressively expand our economic influence"🥸🥸🤡🤡

Hello MMs I was promised something about a 13th day surprise for GME because it’s on some exclusive VIP only guest list
BABA calls easy 5 bagger
that retarded spy bounce just raped my puts. cool cool cool
Been thinking of this for a while lol, will dump it once it arrives at 55.. hopefully by January
Dont just sit there watching your stocks drop like flies, get in where the getting is good. C3.AI (AI) is on the move to 200 eod. Pum pump pump it up.
Don't catch a falling knife.
Power hour ?
All I neeedddddd is a miracle All I needdddddd is a rug pull allineedisarugpull
Holy fuck.
So this stimulus scenario has turned out pretty much as bad as it possibly could have huh?   Nice
Shorts probing stop losses on GME rn
It's okay boys. I remember this all too well. It was Christmas Eve of 2018. Everything was blood fucking red but then a Christmas miracle happened. Mnuchin activated the PPT and with their ample liquidity, boxing day was the greenest MF day I've ever seen. Since boxing day this year is on a Saturday, I have no idea what's going to happen.
closed my CLF calls yesterday at a small profit. holding on MT Mar 19 '21 $30  though
BABA c 215
this is just robot wars.  we are all just along for the algo roller coaster ride.  That sell off yesterday in the last 10 minutes was utterly absurd.  The entire s and p 500 chart looked like it had an infinite slope at the end of the day yesterday. Now a big dip with a stupid bounce up.  Computers are assholes.
waiting for it to do something since weeks ago, it only went bad, maybe it'll move with the deal
[removed]
Please do your part this holiday season to strong arm rob your local console hoarders $SNE
SNAP why you go down 🤌🏻 ya fuk
Think it will actually go above $50 again?
They also post clickbait titles and thumbnails saying March 2.0 is coming every week so
It’s just contract after contract dude, conference on the 6th I think and then live demo on the 26th followed by earnings after, strong chart, strong competition, what else... oh yeah 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Tesla announces new EV and stonks go up, Ford does it and it just stays in boomer land 😤
Margin called?  What's the total loss in dollars you're looking at?
Once TSLA goes the rest of the market will go
It's Early Power Hour; BUY any dips--statistically, the days after Christmas Santa rally. + upside on stimulus. Let's go!!!
10k in GME shares
Thoughts on AAL calls? March-May?
Man so weird the concept I bet must of us have for money now. Down 3000 this week but said wtf when I bought my girl makeup for 70 bucks lmao
If you bought BABA on July 1st, forgot about it until now, and then checked your account you'd have about the same exact amount in your account as you did then.  6 months for nothing.
Why would anyone, who's not Chinese, invest in Chinese companies?
It remains illegal for AMZN to have a good day
Then watch it go higher.
Fuck it, I'm in on MVIS. Let's see where this goes!
haha
STOP THE COUNT
Why the fuck did I buy TAK leaps? Cathie pls
Shares on BABA is the play. It's now 100% of my 401k at $218 average
Correct. Chamath might be the next one after Cathie.
Aside from politics which is very iffy if repubs keep senate-- it really depends on how the fund is actively managed. For example, RUN was biggest holding in October.  Now it's PLUG.  If they move and shake right and politics helps, could be lucrative. Personally, I think most of the big plays in the sector are exhausted and won't have earnings growth to justify these valuations.
Why tf is alibaba down 15%? Is there any reason?
[https://www.reddit.com/r/scamthescalpers/](https://www.reddit.com/r/scamthescalpers/)

GME long squeeze
Listen if you get paid my March 300 make money - let’s hope
Game stop. Technical analysis. 20.20 is the floor for the Gme and the people. Only up from here. Add 10. 30 eoy price target.
It’s power hour! FCEL, get your shit together and shoot up!
Senate rejected the revised bill today because they kept all the foreign money the same just increased the payments to 2k which kind of misses the point
How do you say tendies in retard
You’re retarded if you think BABA will go lower
I think 212 to 217 was short covering personally. Not a lot of motivated longs out there imo
Most obvious dead cat.
Beautiful dip on GOEV today.
Why's today RED?
90%ptlr gme stic, then 10% in some boring blue chip stocks
Enjoy being a hobo
Roughly 220k. I made a second mortgage after it dropped to 260 and bought half calls half shares.
Down
PLTR keeps building lower lows it’s still bullish AF
Fake bounce you’ll be fine
I have never seen a more obvious setup for a blindingly green Monday. Buy the dip fellers
It’s bleeding on extremely low volume, wouldn’t worry about it
Because $ to be made retard,
Goes down, yes.

ARKG 4/16/21 $140c  Just bought 100 of them  This dip is a blessing, please do the same. Thank me later.
Closes at 10 right?
Chinese government proves if they have a monopoly
If SPY ends red, buy calls.
Fuck you bezos and jack ma
But all your cash in $GAY. Not kidding.
BABA is opening +5-10% on Monday. The anti-trust news is overblown.
Yeah, but trump is a dip shit lol I think once he is not longer and office, hopefully the negotiations with china stop being shit, actually if that happens it may moon as it should
AAPL kept up the momentum. VLDR and LAZR on the other hand...
That was the move clearly
Let’s say I have an ITM debit spread on 12/31 and I close the short leg eod 12/31 and close the long leg 1/1... is there any rule against claiming the short leg as a loss for 2020? Or is that covered under the irs definition for “straddles”
What time the market close today for Pacific time?
Rmg!
Soon, play is for 18-20 dollars
Idk how weedmaps makes money but I'm bongs deep in sspk
SPY is green still.
LETS GO
FDX went down $10 today after it’s high of $276, with the only news since then being a price target upgrade.  Yup makes sense.
Yup....       People love to talk about 100% option yolos around here, but only retards do that.        If I had to guess, most WSBers are invested in high volatility stock of small to mid cap companies which might double over the next year.  They also probably play options too, but its a much smaller amount of their account than the stocks.  Still super risky, but not retard risky.
I’ve been staying away from BABA this whole time, but I bought calls for next week. Just a small position. Think it’s at peak fear here.
My gains got run over by a reindeer
BABA RED -&gt; My port that does not have BABA RED = Cyber Covid Virus ? 🤔
It’s finding it’s support at around 18.20s also there are signs of an uptrend coming. Give it another week or so before anything drastic
Lol, we thought the shorts would give up on GME. Nah, these idiots are digging their own grave deeper
Well that was a Federal Intervention bounce if I’ve ever seen one.
10am
Icln leaps 33c you’re welcome
The roof flew off their new model.
Ohh no :(((( sold my BLNK puts really toooo early!!!! 😭😭😭  $2700 potential gains lost 😞
FUCK YOU AMAZON PILE OF TRASH
😂😂😂
you had some sort of other expectations for this sub? it's not fucking /r/investing
Blue chip stocks always win
How long from now does the market close?
Ppl gotta buy last min Christmas gifts 🤷🏽‍♂️
I’ve resigned myself to a Green Monday
Now you down 3070
Can anyone explain why this company which had less than a dozen employees last year is worth so much money?
Ford should make decent ICE cars. They had 50 years to beat the Japanese and couldn’t.   EVs are too much. They should stick to the F-150 (no joke).
Maybe, just maybe, institutional money was what was keeping the market green all along
In 40min
Si when are we getting money?
No reason, just China.
NIO day coming up.  Hold for now
She bought a smallish position - now watch to see what she does next. Winners win.
It broke 20, here comes the free fall
#Jack Bezos and Jeff Ma

We will see the sub 200 baba on Monday, no worries buddy. You're short right?
When they announce its effective with the new strain of covid
Seriously what the fuck GME
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/equity-alert-rosen-law-firm-163200614.html  😂 these sleazy lawyers are ruthless
DONT get upset today boys diamond hands thru next week and you’ll be rewarded handsomely
international diversity. seemed like a good idea when the Chinese economy was recovering faster than the US that's still dealing with the pandemic. bad fuckin choice.
Fuck UPS, all my homies hate UPS

How do you lose your house witth mortgage forbearance through 2022

Market closes early, so day drink the woes away
Because China will dick all over the US in 50 years
Wtf baba
Gme???  I was told thered be a squeeze
Quite a few of them until $12
Wasn't the avg. volume 120mil+ in May/June?
So overblown but I bet we see red again Monday before a rebound
Stimmy is fuck but we're also on a short trading week.  Every short week this year has had a selloff ahead of the holiday.
Just got to play the market sometimes.. watch the herd of sheep and act accordingly.. sometimes financials and analysis doesn’t mean anything.. this is a circus
*Dumping in progress...*
42mins
Not a good move. Baba is a shell company for the real Chinese BABA.   Check SEC filings. Stay far away my dude.
With stonks money?
GME stills manage to ruin Christmas. Managements fault
Are the big tech antitrust suits priced in yet or should I load up on puts
You don’t cause retards don’t actually make tendies
If you bought BABA on October 27th, forgot about it until now, and then checked your account you'd be down 32%.
10am  45min
Jack Ma Dick Off
Should I go all in Amazon dec 31 $3245 calls ?
Nice, I just got CRSR at a discount!  One week later....  Nice, I just got CRSR at a discount!   And repeat....
China is doing "antitrust shit" with them. Probably an excuse for ccp to get in cheap and pump that shit to the moon if you ask me.
what dip do i buy
How difficult would it be to get a job at ARK? Lol
Amazon forming a bear chart. lmao.
Great. Your life savings is in the hands of the CCP. How comforting
at the next red day.
The yt crowd is 🤡🔫
Congressional republicans are the world's biggest cucks. They haven't been fiscally conservative for 4 years and now suddenly they care about the deficit again.
The EV Mustang looks cool but ok
Is god punishing PLTR? All good news about new govt contracts and all this company does is stay flat or go down.
There’s no way I can afford to pay two mortgages. I wanted it to be a quick recovery
Thanks
Besides Ryan Cohen taking a huge stake in GameStop is their any other upside about it? I mean they lose money and they certainly aren’t a startup
How’s Power Hour treating y’all? Closed out all of my positions and waiting for the last 5 minutes to open some for next week.
Be patient. It’s at the pinch point of a pennant. Breaking out soon.
Lol
So it’s power hour now?
Bought the dip yesterday at close. Cashed out my call today at 270% profit. #onlywintoday
no they won't lol.
True true
Thanks
They reconvene on Monday to continue fucking everyone so who knows
Why is Moderna trading red this week?
PLTR forming a giant 1 month long bull flag. Consolidating on declining volume. January is gonna be nice for PLTR.
Power hour not sweating
Are my 12/31 AMD 92c safe?
Guys I feel it in my balls, PLTR 🚀🚀🚀 next week 💎🙌
Yes sir anything for gains 📈
Why the fuck did I get in Amazon calls for next week at the top today Jesus Christ
[removed]
Relax, hold. Normal Christmas closing.
Someone tell me what dip to drop 1k on 🚨🚨🚨
http://dudespaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/fuckit1.jpg
YES! I did not say that did I... Yeah, need a good dip to buy too.
I guess I’m going back to bed after the market close lol  It’s only 10am in California
YOLOd my account on 4/16/21 call debit spreads GME $21/$35
Nio Day coming up too
China will overtake the US
Same.
As more states legalize weed, Weedmaps revenue declines (they’re forced to cut ties with unlicensed shops and deliveries once a state goes through legalization).  Weedmaps business model is built on profiting off of the black market aspect of weed.  This will be a pump and dumper
Boomer stock
Theta will eat your calls by then
Baba
fubo
Anybody else buy this BABA dip? You’d have to be crazy not to, right????
Got my sister a Robinhood account for Xmas and that value is already going down
Come back to this comment in 3 weeks then bro
Isn’t now a good time to stop though?... we should be evolved enough
Same. Got 4x 93c @1.15 each. I will vaporize this money if need be 💎 👐
Yea, you can come out now.  I think,  it's jammed
SNAP!
well they're about to keep making money lol
Yeah cuz Amazon is great in the US 🤡
Guess who had a note in his phone to buy gme calls when it was 4.62 but decided it was worthless instead?  This guy 😎
I’m hoping it pops back up on Monday. Get some back on these and then roll out
Why's GME going down?
happy cake day! 💎🖐
It’s legit and will have a run up before Nio day on the 9th of January
Literally no one even knows about it yet. Did PLTR or CRSR take off immediately? No, it took time
🧠
GME weeklies dude is it even a question, week after Christmas gonna make GME moon
Republicans spend money like it's 1999 when it's a republican president and force capital hill to pinch pennies during democratic presidencies
C3.Ai (AI) 2021 is gonna 📈
Just show em your wsb profile. Im pretty sure theyd make you cfo or something
No woes just boredom

Drop iguana’s in Florida?? Watch yah dome bois
So I’m on the train and there’s a sign that says “Priority Seating, for persons with disabilities”  Some tard gets on the train, almost sits down there, then hauls ass to get off the train as doors are closing screeching “let me out let me out”  Which one of you autists was this and what play hurt you? Bc I felt that
max pain is $20
On Monday it d better be limit up
I bought 4/16 250c
Going all in BABA in your 401k is the most autistic thing I've heard all day. Welcome to the short bus pal, you belong here!
****Let’s keep it simple****   G H I V  FCEL  PLUG  I P O C   ALL gave you good dip buys today. These 4 should be on your portfolio for January no doubt

Baba is about to rip
Wendys gift card would have been better
I'd be lying if I said I knew lol. I'm just hoping it pumps
I don’t buy. I sell.
Buy the NIO dip. Nio is going to launch soon as Nio Day approaches.
Iv on pltr options sucks now, still wheeling though
#fake dump
Because it’s Christmas Day?
Alright market. Sell off until close. Let’s get this over with
They are not making any money. They are underwater, and have been this whole time. There's been about 70 million shares short for months now
Yeah that’s why I’m asking for a rebound..
200 more shares GME!
Damn, why you hate your sister that much?
MM's successfully bound PLTR to 28 this week. This war is a long one but we are slowly breaking them!
Thanks guys, but losing all my money in baba was really my own fault
Supreme leader Winnie the Pooh thank you for the BABA discount
GME profit taking incoming tome to scalp puts
Can we make it a temporary honorary meme stock then?  Partnership with Walmart, PT upgrades, vaccine distribution, busy holiday shipping season. Fuck
Robinhood should give us a free stock for Christmas to be honest 🎄 🎁
JACK MA PLEASE TELL SUPREME LEADER WINNIE THE POOH YOU’RE SORRY
F
Took a nap. I was green. Woke up red. Merry fucking Christmas
Motherfuckers, SPY leaps will print. QQQ leaps will print. AAPL leaps will definitely print.   Instead everyone is grabbing 12/31 GME and PLTR calls like true goddamn 🤡s
yes.
Blame the CCP
Don't matter, if they failed today already shows Republicans aint having it.
Calls going up in value on flat MU trading...
That’s okay I just enjoy your stories grandpa
40 minute full thrust 🌝
But think about it though. the Santa rally comes because of people's merry moods after holidays, right? This Christmas is gonna be complete shit. That should mean the market is gonna be shit, too. And if the market is shit, inexperienced investors are gonna sell out thinking "Why isn't it up? This is supposed to be the Santa rally!", causing stocks to go down even more and leading to a correction of &gt;1 percent.   &amp;#x200B;  Just my two cents. I hope I'm wrong.
Starting to see that lol
Once again I here to announce that door dash is pumping on very little volume.  Very cool, very legal!
It has almost 2 billion issued shares
Jack Ma said some pretty funny shit about Xi and Xi is making an example out of him. This isn’t gonna bode well for baba
Are we sure it’s going to go up again or is it over leveraged?
Goodbye gamestoooooooppppppp
Baba lmao mooning
I will
Gonna run up for nio day
BABA, Sum Ting Wong! Wi Tu Lo!
Agreed brother.
Buy the dip
Fuck it.. I got in GME

Power hour coming in on christmas eve like a limp dick
Yep 1 EST
Damn another massive intraday decline for AAPL

Buy rmg
EZ BABA V SHAPE RECOVERY
Glad I sold the 12/24 GME 22C's for a profit of 10 bucks earlier, haha. Bought right near EOD yesterday.
I'm tellin' you bitches, BABA has a few more days of dumpage before it turns around.  But don't listen to me, I ain't learnt shit.  "iT's *bO*unCin*G"*  Nope, downtrends have pullbacks just like uptrends do.
wall street still mad about the direct listing
BABA coming back to life 🐂📈🚀🚀🚀
GHI.v is definitely gonna POP as they have a meeting Jan 20 to affirm everything. Calls before then.  It’s still cheap in terms of SPAC’s ~ $13 range currently  Jan 15 $15c for a 5 bagger maybe more.

Still got my shares though.
It's all fake
BABA got jingle belled
How much would a company with the revenue, gross profit, PE ratio, etc. of BABA be worth if it was an American company?
Can all the "thank me later" dudes chime in with the final score today so we can "thank" them 🤣🤣🤣
Congrats to those who bought GME puts yesterday. I was too much of a pussy 😤😤

GME Christmas Eve sale price going on from now until 1pm as gaybears throw everything they have at it to keep it below 20 at close.  Buy at 12:58 for the cheapest price you're ever gonna get again.
Caviar finally came in the mail. Just made eggs w caviar. Thanks wallstreetbets from turning me from white trash into pretentious wealthier white trash.     If you aren't buying the ARK dips you are fucking up. Also in STIC for the memes.

Jan $15c has almost 3k vol
Look what they did to my boy CRSR
Of course Brexit goes through then $BCS sinks like a stone. The sell the news plays are kinda tough because you have to sell IMMEDIATELY on the news or you're too late. Now I'll wait for re-entries on $BCS to sell.

On the next episode of wallstreetbetZ
They have 125 clients that on average give 5M each, and return each time. From the new contracts we saw, they get much more than 5M per client... 80% margins, you do the math! 🚀
Could of got out up 1k at 11 am now down 4k. Marry fucking Christmas
But buy investing in China you're actually making that happen, without foreign investments they wouldn't be anywhere near as well off as they are now, and by helping them you're negatively influencing the US economy, meaning there will be less good jobs here.
Is grandma getting you VOO shares for Christmas
I hope at least 1 person listened to me 🥺
Nah I’m sure someone bought in at 319

We’re past cool now. Companies are making EVs for the masses. Things are moving fast. Evolve or die.
Fuck I all I’m on BABA, worst thing that could happen is I kill myself
Everyone buying calls is why I'd get puts.
“China Jack” to a gulag?? $ BABA  🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸!!

What y'all thinking about ZM calls? Going to be added to the S&amp;P on January. Buy the dip?
Is this good or bad for ARK? Cause they might be buying a very problematic asset
Finally, we won't have to hear about brexit talks anymore.
Don’t quote me but look at that volume. We’ll see after close. Hard to imagine they’re not adding today considering they just bought shit ton of BABA two days ago

Bought SQ  June 18 300C lets gooo
Whats going on with GME? Is it shorts, puts, or are people selling shares?
Anyone else looking at AMZN 1/22 calls? 3250 or 3500 for me.  Its a week before earnings and amzn will release numbers for christmas by next week.  Plus next week is usually pretty green
Stable Roads Warrants  11.50 strike expire may 2026 yes 2026  going for 6 bucks  free money

There is Orthodox Christmas  on January 7, u will be good by then
WHAT IS THE BABA PLAY
It’s only just begun
It ran up 50% because Apple will use 3rd party sensors for its cars. No mention of which company’s sensors. I think this “dip” is going to be around for a while.
I can't stop buying CRSR dips
More tendies🚀
Baba I'm cumming!!!!
I found a new algo i am running and I am making $2200 a week. All I had to do was delete my robinhood app.
Any one else buy BABA FD’s for next week? I got some 250c
Me holding baba today: “I didn’t hear no bell.”
If you feel down about your positions just remember this volume is ass berries, all the big dick bulls are home eating turkey and will be out banging their side piece tonight. They will come back Monday and see this juicy dip and slap that buy button with their big bull weiner.
Lol dump resuming. Shocker.

Are you delivering lots of Chinese food? Idk why that's a popular Christmas Eve dinner
I’m holding my PLTR NIO ARKK. NIO and PLTR till at least their respective big days January and maybe longer tho not sure and ARKK til I probably die
Of course you would take it, who wouldn’t.  And that is the very role the government is intended to fill.  Imagine if they hadn’t bailed out the banks or motor companies from 2008.  People wouldn’t be saying “so what, that’s business.”  Hell imagine they hadn’t passed the CARES act this year?  At what amount do you decide it’s okay for a pandemic to kill hundreds of thousands of people?  Millions had they done nothing at all.
Puts are down 50% lmao
It ran up 30% take profits and hop back in next week
Market just pulled out it’s dead dick today

Lucky bastard. Imo its a super underrated stock that not many are looking at
BABA dipped 8.63% on the big lockdown back in March... this is insane.
Short squeeze Man the banks have to unwind their shorts as buyers rush in its simple
Did anyone here play BABA 0 dte puts at open? How much % gains you make?
AAPL abyss
I bought $250 LEAP's... Should fill today's gap and go ITM soon.
Christmas 🎄 numbers could be pretty bleak this time. Even Black Friday was nothing much to talk about
That is the way. Leaps on SQ
[removed]
That’s a good point. Are you expecting as big of a run up in price as there was for the last two generations in consoles?
I bought calls on the dip. Its a blessing
Baba really is that play today that next week everyone’s going be like fuck it was so obvious
I can tell Sarah Eisen is some where else because her lighting is so different. Looks like she's in her in-laws bedrooom walk-in closet.

Damn it. Tastyworks sold off my 0DTE GME $20 call that I was down 30% on... They probably saved me from a bigger loss but fuck , what if it 🚀
Leaps or 0DTE calls if you have big balls
I welcome a GME brother back at any price point.   That being said we might find out that jack ma has been executed EOD
Oh haha didn’t even check. My bad
refresh
No fucking humidity
Microsoft was built in a garage. They knew their market. They are what they are now. AI is the next money saver for companies. Talkin a platform where companies can develop code without as many human bodies involved. Speculation is going to be so 2020 when this thing moons in 2021. Why do you hate money?
QS needs to drill here
Nio
Already all in pltr
And GME is still a bad business.
Lots of bagels in the morning, and some alcohol
Sorry, that sux 😔
Shout out to the fucker who keeps dumping after every rip
GME is slowly dipping fellas. It means how things. Short holders are desperately trying to drive the price down, which means if it dips below 19 get back in with every spare dollar you can afford to lose. This thing is gonna jump back up next week at some point. Again, shares, not options. No weeklies retards! If you’ve been selling at the top and buying at the bottom consistently with GME you’ve already been printing money. Get in now because we’re either getting a MOASS or just the stock returning to its actual value, which is way higher than any of the mainstream cucks give it credit for.
“facing no repercussions”   ultimate bull flag
Going to need Mango to sign the bill.  GOP - get your boomer in order
imagine if BABA V shaped back to 250 in 30 mins
Dude this nio drill is uncalled for
GME right guys? Where did the confirmation bias queers go?
Once again selling BABA puts was free money.
If anyone needs evidence, just watch the interview with Elon. LMAO what an absolute retard! An average WSB user probably knows more about machine learning than Ma.
BABA Calls? Sell at close?
Blood in the street, I will sell Baba in a few minutes and buy even more GME shares
From one guy who likes free money to the rest of you, get in on ALPP as soon as you can
Why the fuck isn't the market open tomorrow. Red and green, it's what Jesus would have wanted.
The baba dip will be remembered all of 2021
Right, and with holidays (11/11, Black Friday, and Christmas), they should be report a great Q4 2020 in Feb, I’d assume anyways..
Fuck the CCP
NVTA is a fucking bitch to hold
QQQ street fight at $309, damn...
Dems have to win both seats to gain majority and odds aren't favorable
Let it touch 19.99 and I’ll buy another 200 shares. Cmon. Get at me bro.
Me and my shares are just watching the shitshow from the sidelines
Low volume fuckbag day. Back to normal Monday
They said that last week
Sell at low then buy again when they go up
Never. That's disgusting
BABA the Phoenix
Hope you recover bro try to work and make some bank next month to make payments to both mortgage and margin you might survive this
Don't forget Bang Ding Ow
What do you guys think about cruise stocks? Basically guaranteed to shoot later on and constantly go on sale. Also because space lingo is a direct copy of boating lingo, does that mean confirmed moon??
Okay? I'm talking about literally 99% of them not the few vultures who shorted GME after a 7 dollar gain in 2 days
I actually prefer morning football lol
god speed
BABAAAA
BABA be like: last night a took an L, but tonight I bounce back
You fucking pussies lol
Yeah I bailed
your point?
another spy pump
Just hold amigo.
Revenge trading and greed
You are welcome
It opened at 228 so probably not much.
Where do you get 80% margins? I see they lost $500mn last year. If they do 80% that's great news, just haven't seen that
so what are next steps on stim?
No government faces repercussions unless it's ruling a third-world country.
Pretty sure quite a few blokes here bought BABA puts at 215 😂😂😂
Warnock is a socialist who did a eulogy for Fidel Castro

We are in a bearish market now nerds, do the math

“Note in his phone” try a limit order next time 👍
all in on BABA  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀
Buy the dip
Going to laugh so hard if BABA somehow rips for 35 minutes to green.
libertarians who voted on Nov 3 will move to the Repubs probably. I don't think either Dem wins in the runoff.
Fuck it I’m doubling down on my BABA puts
I’m telling you all because we’re in it together. Don’t be scared, and by leap calls for BABA. Or at least a few months out. It might go down a little more, no one knows. I highly doubt it’s going below $200. Now is a good time. Print money with me. Ignore the “smart” kids that don’t belong in WSB and belong in r/investing. We’re here for high risk high rewards, that is the WSB way. 🚀
MO BABAAAAAAAAA
STONKZ
Lol you are clearly delusional if you think Authoritarian means communism.  China abandoned communism when Deng Xiaoping took power in the late 1970s. They have private property, competitive markets, a central government, and other characteristics that are incompatible with communism. They are a one-party state-capitalist nation, not a communist one.  Does everyone here have any idea of their history?  Since when do you have private property in communism lol
Her internet is garbage. Hilarious she forgot to turn her monitor on or something and she had fireworks on behind her

the smart play. I’m saving my options degeneracy for the new year
My lthm July calls are down 10%. These don't expire for another six plus months but I always freak out and sell when it drops. Really fighting the urge to sell

Yeah. But quite a strong one. Doesn’t go down much
Sell every BABA rip from here on out. CCP cares more about party control than "capitalism"
NVDA huge dark pool prints yesterday if anyone follows flow algo, with textbokm consolidation for a month (1% movement). Today might be a good entry. Buying half my March and June calls now and half end of day.  Afterwards I'll look for a catalyst because it's over due for a big rally.
I wouldn't think so. Unless you mean puts. Fact is the ccp has it out for Ma and they are going to dismantle him.
#BABA rally!!!
Just die so I can buy back in again TSLA
Buy BABA dip! The news will come out over the long weekend that it was just a lil warning and Jack Ma will bow to his commie overlords and be a good CEO so he doesn’t get sent to the gulag.
Told you guys BABA 0 DTE 220c was the play
Megamind lookin ass

BABA starts ripping my marxh calls start dipping...went 7% in the last 3 minutes as BABA ripped 5 up...🤣
It really pisses me off how so many SQ card readers seem to default to a tip option even for transactions that never required a tip before. That has nothing to do with me buying 0dte at the top this morning.
Was watching BABA all morning and didn't manage to get spreads filled at the lowest dip. Ah you can't always time these things.
Those cucks don't know about auntie Cathie.
Just bought 200 shares. Another 200 of it touches 19

Man, now that was some great DD.   Everyone listen to [RetardTrader420](https://www.reddit.com/user/RetardTrader420/).
BABA shares
Nothing. Just turn around. Today is not the day.
Did we ever get a definitive answer on who built the cages or is that still up in the air?
Doubled down on feb calls, lets get it
Not understanding this bullshit with Penn at all
BABA you got this, Jack Ma, you’re my boy!!
Dude you are spamming this so transparently hard, chill out a bit
Rip GME boys
Look I'm not gonna call you retarded or anything but the short interest has been over 100% of float literally this whole time

BABA already up 9$ from the bottom
Thanks, saw your comment earlier and threw funny money into FD calls
I think today was just end of year profiting. Over a month you will still get a return
BABA pump ended my life
Lol
Thank you
All good
Interesting
What the fuck is GME doing, down so much
One week til steel starts pumping🚀🚀
Great play I’m in for 2 contracts
I just went to one of the wealthiest areas and now i feel poor😕 Everyone’s got a huracan, g wagon, Bentley, or Porsche
&gt; pleas
I’m buying the CYRX dip. Im feeling it.
I FUCKING HATE AMAZIN AND NIO SO FUCKING MUCH
LOADED UP!! 🚀
great DIP!!!
Nah my shit expires 22nd of January. Ik i shouldn’t be worried but seeing me down so much makes it tough lol
Employees and the CEO will be allowed to sell shares on the 31st. They are prevented from selling due to SEC ipo rules.
Im holding july 25/30call spreads. Shit was like $100.  Super cheap and i think pretty likely to hit considering this holiday season has been all online
So I guess BB isn't popping off past 7.50 afterall
NVDA has been so garbage last 3 months. What's up with it?
wish someone did this for me 3 days ago
Maybe June 280’s are the better play.....
Drill baba you bitch
Hold the gme line at 20
At least Intel is green lol
The government should have let GM fail, like they let the shareholders fail. Why should GM the company be bailed out for its incompetence? Who loses? The consumers still need cars, they will buy from Ford, and other companies instead, GMs assets would be auctioned off, and the workers would seek out new opportunities at Ford, or other car companies, or maybe in a different industry.  They shouldn’t have passed the cares act either, the government had no right to shut down business for “14 days,” so I mean you’re saying they had to give people money cause they fucked them over by closing down? I mean yeah I guess but my idea would be not to close down in the first place, and if you keep giving money to the states you’re incentivizing more lock downs.
Chet
Vince McMahon freaking out gif
I went from rags to riches with BABA
*sAnTa ClAuSe RaLlY*  Shit was murdered by stimulus talks
As much as it sucks seeing my account go to hell, it's a bit reassuring knowing I'm not alone on this red day.   Merry Christmas, nerds.
🤡
Pre market is happy hour IMO
Had a buy orde at 20, but fomo'd 400 at 20.3. Rip ez 120 extra dollar. A lot for newbie like me
Who else is left holding the ARKK bags 😭
thank you!
I broke my own rule and listened to one of the retardd here and bought RIOT calls two days ago. Never buy what you don't know 🤦‍♂️
I don’t get how it’s possible. How is it possible that everything I buy puts in fucking moons? It makes no sense. It every fucking time to. Doesn’t matter what the fucking stock is. I’m not even gonna say what I got puts in now.
Supermarket I was just in announced that they can no longer process any EBT or gift card purchases   Real talk that fucking sucks day before Xmas
10 CONTRACTS $250c 12/31 BABA CALLS  4 CONTRACTS $200p 12/31 baba puts     We will see which direction this bad boy goes in
What dips are you guys waiting for to buy into for 2021?
How do you know when it is lol
GME u/DeepFucking value rode this down to 13 and back.  Cohen was buying more in the 16s.  Paper hands at 20?  Fuck no.  💎👐 boys.
Don’t they know they’ve been on the 13 day list?
Nah another short week. All plays should be made for January or don't play at all.
Amen.
Lmao, AMZN will never be at $3000 again in your lifetime.

It’s down 55 cents....
Stock price goes up but my calls go down, is that how it works over there in China?
Holy shit that TSLA green dildo just now
Really didn't expect that power hour BABA pump.  Wouldn't trust it with free money though.
Rip. Sorry for your puts
Been there.  Old company was based in orange county Ca and our annual meetings were at Balboa Bay Yacht club
STOP THE COUNT!
Yeah, seems like a solid play. I’m hoping for it to pop and hit 20$ sometime by the jan 20, but who knows.
Pinning SPY at 368 today? Lame. Idc which direction, just go fast
If it breaks 215 there is no support until 200. That’s about a 25%-30% drop on leaps. It’s worth waiting to see what happens monday before hopping in.
[deleted]
Its shit

$MT announced they will start mining B T C
Jokes on them, when everyone has one, it's like no one does
Bought the baba dip. Big money on the call side
You lyin
Amazon is so gsy
What a totally shit day. Can the holidays be fucking over already.
why would China face repercussions for a pathogen from the wild? this pandemic type shit happens every so often, it's spread was impossible to contain in the era of globalization + international plane travel.   if you think otherwise, you've limited sensibility
No stimmy means lil timmy has no money for GME games
i always had CHWY in the BECKY portfolio man youve been missing out
Pls fly BABA
BABA ripping but my 250c FD is flat. I’m. I’m not worried though.
Holy fuck it’s looking bleak across everything today. Fuck U Santa
That’s reasonable
We OWN GME how did we let this happen??
when i lived in chicago i had to dvr all my west coast sports (lakers, dodgers, kings, sc football) and watch that shit the next day. so lame. west coast is the best coast - big e smalls (i think)

It’s literally up 26% for the week what more do you people want
GME shares if you want to live
BABA will close at least 230
They just diluted shares what, 2 weeks ago? It traded in the $7-10 range until this week. $14 is the top imo until more positive news.
BABA slow bleed down to 180 over the next three weeks.
Buy the damn BABA dip 🚨 🚨 🚨
Jack MA I averaged down show me those brass balls u have let’s go
All of you who bought BABA, serves you right for betting against America.   Unless you're actually from China, then that's fine, but not if you live in the US.
🌙 🚀 🌙 🚀
sell my LAZR 1/15 30ps? I have a feeling it's going to run on Monday
Ya almost 3 percent ass fuck
Looks like Xi sold his puts.
lol my BABA leaps were worth more at $212 than they are at $221 now      Fuck off, IV
ts really amazing that the key to financial freedom lies now in the correct sequence of buttons pressed on one's smartphone.   Press the right button, you're up in the clouds. Press the wrong button... you start over.
Imagine buying GME 22c 12/31
It’s so obvious that door dash is manipulated so fukin much. I mean all the market gets rekt and this fuker stays up 😡😡
jesus big pump
Mama Cathie pls bless us
Both legs of my BABA call spread are up lol option magic

Can someone inform me why so many stocks are shitting the bed rn? I mean I’m 💎🙌🏾but I’m still curious
Haha you’re poor

You know, in fairness, BABAs choose 1 of 2 policy is pretty shady and monopolistic
Meanwhile over at TSLA
Shit is flatter than Anne Hathaway's ass
Thinking about buying more airline shares. There is a good chance airlines will recover in 2021. Should I buy now or wait?
Lately they’ve just been mining a hole to bury my calls in
Holy fuck spy is mooning get in now or miss out on the biggest opportunity of your life
Yeah I’m hoping for that. Get a nice scalp
Ok handjobs in the Wendy's parking lot for you then.

So we are picking who gets to fail?  They also bailed out Ford...
To be clear, im not leaving. I took the opertunity to buy more calls
I got a head start and bought a bunch of shit before the dip 🤡
Second time I’ve seen this verbatim
*Merry
Absolutely SMACKED today, ooops
Buy the BABA dip? The investigation might well only result in a slap on the wrist...
What makes you say that
I’d bet my left nut on this
Who are the retards that truly thought AAPL was gonna kill TSLA and bought puts? I wanna shake their hand lol
Apologies to the guys i sold nio and pltr calls to today, im a business man i was just doing business

Can you actually sell them?
Smart doing the same haha
Stop being a Bear and join a winning team bro. Bull 4 Life
And you think it went up 40% in 2 days organically? That's what a short squeeze looks like. Yesterday was it.  The short interest is probably stable from week to week because shorts are going to re enter here.
Made me check....
Believe they have some catalysts coming in the new year. NIO will be fine
Bft pump in 3...2....1.....
my spy puts just went from positive to negative in 1 minute. FUN!
Are you lost? This is a Chinese sub...?
Handle forming on CRSR daily
I just bought ARKK @133.42 and am hoping it takes back off Monday and this is just a shitty Christmas
I have GME CSPs @20 on 12/31 and cover calls @25 on 12/31. I wonder which one will hit.
That’s why they called it PAC12 after dark lmao
I bought gme 25 12/31 today... I feel I belong here no matter what happens with it
Chill out man it’s up almost 30% this week
BABA with the classic dead cat bounce. RIP
Meaning? Higher IV/risk?
cant wait for that fucking cocksucker to disappear

Oh yeah? What’d you pick up?
Wiyh nothing to show for it
at least with 0dte you know when you lose, never know when winnie the pooh or mang0 will pull the rug on chinese stocks
im never gonna bet aginst tsla again...  &amp;#x200B;  i hope it crashes to the ground next week tho   lol
Why the fuck are you buying weeklies on ark
Apparently China cares about monopolies? I had no idea, I thought that was kind of the whole thing over there.
Goes red in one day and you think it's RIP? Where is your foresight
GME &gt;&gt;&gt; BABA
i sold 10 dte 25c covered calls yesterday for .75 cents  I couldnt believe what dummy would buy that
BABA ends the day at $230 and my leap will be ITM
it's probably because you're betting against the trend  the trend is why buy the dip works  learn to identify the trend
Crsr has dipped 15% from its week high in two days. Yeah very normal behavior. Talk about fomo before earnings.
You trolling me rn? Or this actually a thing
What do you think of 670c tsla 12/31
I heard laughing in cnbc background
Chinese numbers are always right
Brk.B is mooning. Help my 2021 dream come true by making Buffet sell his own stock because it’s become a meme
Buying opportunity for CRSR and GOEV?
do you not look at SPY and QQQ?
Use 2008 run up as a reference point and hope/dream for something much much bigger, but also understand that it might just run up to the $60s-80s naturally   Either way I’m jumping ship summer 2021 unless Cohen pulls something out of his ass.  Then I’ll stay longer
Msft moonage
Nothing worse than Apple cucking every company that uses its platform

AAPL Calls EOD?
Username checks out
But we’re red, good day, no? Just for shares
This shouldn’t be the last of the BABA bad news so I guess I’ll wait
for sure, ambitious too.  it's just crazy how many folks actually have success following up their initial attempt.  the pool shrinks considerably the number of people who can do it twice, three times, more
bought more pltr and gme yesterday, i can only afford to eat cup noodles this Christmas
so when is steel week? next week?
Who’s in VALE? Really want to dump my March calls
Um um um short squeeze at 12:55? 😭💎🙌

Uhhhhh CRSR doesn’t have a bottom 🤧
FCEL and FUBO
Apple 134 close would be amazing
Buying the BABA dip ofc. But I also think JD is a strong buy rn since they're a substitute for BABA in terms of ecommerce in China.
Lol good luck
Santa Claus is not real. This is the lesson we can all take from this week.

My portfolio is very festive, lots of red and green.  But mostly red.
I hate this realization too
I'm here just to make money. Bought more at 220. BABA is like an Asian Amazon+Google+Facebook. It's insanely massive.

Yes. Just being patient now. Nio should be 55+ in mid January.
Santa knew about Epstein’s island.
rip FUBO?
Did anyone get into BABA today?
I'm gonna be a little poetic.  It's always darkest before the dawn
Raise your hand if you bought the XL top  👋
PLTR boys 🚀🚀🚀 watch this video it’s 5 min you’ll learn a little something! Merry Xmas! ANAL KING 👑
AMZN puts printing!
Short weeks and short days can lick my asshole
BABA still at a discount price... get in now or forever hold your peace
Why the hell is blink charging up 12 percent today
RMG up 20% today now.
Dark Knight Rises, the scenes with catwoman on her bike 🍑
SPY with a huge green cock
Shares
Highest daily volume for BABA since 2014. Yikes.
Buy PLTR puts please
Every week....in my pants.  Don't fuck commoditees randomly.

Get a credit card and max it out
Alright well today was pretty uneventful, besides my TSLA yolo calls recovering .  Time to go back to bed. Merry Christmas everyone 😄
I did
Yo let me pick up some of that autistic Apple for the cheap cheap is all i'm asking for this Christmas Santa
XL just keeps dropping and dropping
Y’all sleeping on insg, ez 10X
Having an order in below bid and not getting a fill is probably the most frustrating experience known to man
We the consumer should decide who fails, with our purchases. If a company cannot survive off of the consumers purchases, it should not exist.   What you are proposing is that the government picks winners and losers, as opposed to the market picking winners and losers. What you are saying is inherently unfair to smaller business/small people, because the small guy isn't in the room drafting bailout legislation, but big business is. Big business and big government work hand in hand to consolidate each others winnings.
Nothing to degen on today unless I want to bet on middle eastern soccer. Today is a withdrawal symptom kinda day. Might watch uncut gems today to get in the spirit
Yes to 20
Which dip to buy?? 🤔 GME,RIOT PACB already have FCEL
Santa is real because BABA was selling for $211 today.
added another 500 GME shares at 19.97 and sold 24c for 1/15 to bring it down closer to 18.5, won't complain if i lose them.  Cohen's $16.02 Dec-18 buy as my guide
-1500
Yolo rest on Rmg
&gt;charging up  noice
will we see a christmas miracle at last? 🤩
MMs unlikely to let 220c scalpers win, just saying
BABA dumping again
F my life been staring at this shit for a freaking month
USA: congress can’t agree on shit and shutdown looks likely and same goes for stimulus  China: clamping down on big tech, I think it’s part of a bigger picture so China can look like it gives a shit about global rules/laws but the impact isn’t great  Europe: Brexit should be good news for the market, but having the world’s largest economies fucking around is going to put weight this  Oh and many equities  are overpriced as well and there is a massive imbalance with far too many call options outstanding versus the puts in the market so this helps drag shit down as market makers aren’t worried about fucking themselves on put obligations.
BABA black sheep have you any tendies?
Stop trying to make PLTR happen, it ain't gonna happen.
crap, bought OTM PUT this morning, was about double profit, now its red, lul, anyway it will goona bounce back to the dip, because grow now it is just housekeepers decided to buy "chep" (sheit)
Some of you are gonna lose your ass if BABA does a dead cat
CNBC anchor talking about SQ and Cash app and finishes the segment by saying, “I will Venmo you”.  Smh
Fucking SPY, I knew you gonna pull this shit
Big money definitely getting into BABA
I just did, Chinese will keep iron ore prices in check
Its priced in, no?
Who wants buy a car called Apple   Only 🌈🌈🌈🐻
people have been saying january is when things will get crazy
🐶
I can’t wait to load up Monday
Friendly reminder to stop selling GME you fucks.
Yes absolutely there is.
Down 15% for the week, merry fuckin Christmas
For sure, Santa delivers presents to kids everywhere.
amzn is trash
Based on if trumps says it’s a no go or not
KG!
Is the new strain priced in?
Mattresses must be a hot commodity for Christmas
DKNG pleas fly again
what is fcel bottom? looking to buy in
Yeah, they have a 600 billion USD market cap, so the market just priced in an 80 billion hit. PE is 30 vs AMZN 90...
-50% contracts better than $0.01 contracts
Lol
I can definitely agree with that! Thanks for the response
Congrats to whoever got into AIRT. Wow!
&gt;GME  If you're on a rocketship, and it goes up, but suddenly it starts to fall back down before clearing the atmosphere, is that not cause for worry?
Wait, what?
Still trying to make sense of this Tidal rumor
solid play i did something similar
300c BABA 04/21??
Big vote on Monday. Republicans still don’t want to pay 2k so we gotta hope unemployment and runoffs light a fire under their asses
CRM WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING!?! THE MARKET'S GOING BACK UP, WHY ARE YOU DROPPING BACK DOWN?!?!
"thats right little Jack, before you were born your dad bought the BABA dip"
Took a gamble and bought NKLA puts yesterday even though they already lost 10%. Feel like unless something drastic happens they only got one way to go
I did
I bought on March 16th, I couldn't care less, long future ahead 🚀🚀🚀🚀
what do you think of the other competitors? one of them was up 10% today due to baba news
Anyone buying FB calls? 🤔
Bought baba calls at 212 but IV was so fucked that I’m still down lol
Who else is holding everything bags right now
BABA
How low are you on the CNBC totem pole if you are working today while Cramer is off?
Last time ppl bought the dip on BABA it kept drilling. its down $100 in a couple of months
At this point we all should just continually buy puts for the end of the week trading days.
Spy went stairs down elevator up with decent volume
Perfect going into the tax deadline
Prepare for liftoff 🚀
Coz I bought calls. Sorry
Yes I understand. IV isn’t bad but no volume on my strike. Hoping it picks up on Monday.
what could go wrong with having a portfolio where every investment is one in disruptive tech/products... plus long OTM calls? hmm maybe time to get spy puts
I mean, what would you consider success? Maybe he doesn’t bring GME to a 40bn market cap, but he could at least double it just by refocusing their business. Once we start seeing deals being made (I’m thinking something similar to Xbox Gamepass) we’ll have a better idea of his plans. But he is ambitious for sure, you have to respect it.
Pretty much all my stocks are red today, yay
Trump must have called Loeffler and Perdue and said he'll sign the bill
oh shiet BABA on sale
Bought in at $11 and haven’t sold yet thankfully. My $15 5/21 calls are up like 2500%
why did i go in again?
[removed]
DKNG plz
Sigh.. trump pls stop fucking NIO up
Imagine imagining using your imagination.  SPY $400c 1/15/21
Cathie Wood buying $BABA today?
jack ma looks like a human lego figure
All my NIO gains wiped in 2 days
The truest retard statement on this sub
&gt; yee-yee ass  This description always makes me lol
I told you BABA won’t go pass 200 today
Makes sense YouTube is a red logo
BABA preparing for lift off
Been playing CRM for a while, it has always done that. It follows the dips but doesn’t recover. Finally dropped it yesterday
ORI shares are literally free money next week.  https://finance.yahoo.com/news/old-republic-declares-special-one-164900146.html
ARKF and ARKW getting ready for a Mars mission.
CNBC coverage today is wild -  *I will venmo you six pinecones for one fake duck*
BABABACK??
I bought 5x 525c expiring in March. $20k in. Good idea?
If you are selling today you are gay
I need baba at 230 in 10 minutes so I can sell before my break ends
I’m holding... at least for now.
God I'm such a clown I can't pick a winner anymore, fucking bought fastly at the top today
I think I'm gonna go buy one here in a couple minutes.
CRSR, who hurt you?
How big of a hit?
Mgni take me to the moon baby 🌕💸
👍🏻
Yes, there is.
Tonight is Christmas Eve not last time brother
Is she actually?
[removed]
Should i buy nio or gme?
What a fucking shit day
&lt;$11
Fuck baba
LRCX has risen
RMG but actually 🚀
Ok I have 20 minutes to save the Christmas I’ve needlessly endangered
shakeout of weak hands
And CRM
amazing
What was the DOE?
Ring the fucking bell
At this rate probably after the inauguration
BABA getting a bid from some [HFT and block buying](https://twitter.com/HFTAlert/status/1342153090284150784)
im up 20% on my 225c for next week  did you buy the ask on accident?
Can go to 20 before February good buy in right now
game sucks
Elevator down soon, probably to the parking garage too
It bounced right off my enter key with I was hovering puts
At least my FTEC shares still love me.
Hold your Tesla shares boy and gals Tesla truck coming soon!
Did you mean get out out now? Their ccp antitrust lawsuit hasn't even started.
Amazing that I could've skipped 700 moves this year and just bought SQ and CRWD and been dramatically richer
Seriously. the demographic of that area is very EBT focused...  The announcer sounded kinda nervous lol   I'm sad because I went to buy gift cards for xmas
Woof BABA, what a day. Sold my puts early at 100% profit, but if I'd held on to midday, my contacts clocked in at over 500% profit at some points. No matter, profit is profit!
I made some mostly due to stic. Most stocks seem to be down today. Mostly holding GME and ARK funds
Bois we have a 🏳️‍🌈🐻
You could do that, or my preference is to roll to a longer dated call at a higher strike. So farther out than 7/16
Same
Done bought 16 and some assine weeklies.
Been red all day
Read?
Lol ?Genius??
Better than ISIS reject looking ass Jack Dorsey
me
[removed]
😉
Same lmao
Hells yeah.
GME if you want risky big gains in the next 3 months, NIO if you want safer gains but over a one year period.
aapl terrified of closing above 132
Feb 12 2021.
Yes when the game is over at 10pm it’s already like 1-2am on the east coast lmao
Why did NIO die today
yugh that movie is so skuzzy
“Alright guys we need to pass a COVID relief bill. We can probably fit everything on like 15-20 pages right?”  “Hmm, maybe. But what if instead we made it six thousand pages and put a bunch of weird shit into it?”
Any good credit spreads to set up over weekend ?
How much money did you actually spend on [gamestop.com](https://gamestop.com) the last few weeks?
Pinduoduo? Hmmm, since they're already up over 10% today I'd probably stay away. However, if you're buying the BABA dip, then if more bad news comes out, Pinduoduo might be a good hedge.
Baba loading thrusters
Apple warming up 🔋🔋🔋
Big IMO. A good one.  They have a great business model and have prototypes that have already been crash tested, are driveable, etc. as well as contracts with UPS and Hyundai.  US based as well
I deserve a cookie
They all panic sold? Pomp eet
🙋‍♂️
Don't mind me, just another friendly reminder that the market closes in 20 minutes and tomorrow is a market holiday.  Happy holidays everyone
Prpl made me such money today and i STILL sold too early. FML.   Oh well, gains are gains right? 😐
GOEV is brutalizing my bunghole
nothing is priced in
rotation into baba dip
So we buying baba or waiting for it to keep dropping?
Damn 400% left on the table.  BIG OLE L FOR YOU
Think I’ll buy into PERI dip
Wtf pltr
Monday. Most likely Trump will sign so the economy and government literally doesn't go into the shitter, but there's still the possibility of him leaving it on the oval desk to die.
Can I get some opinions on Visa calls
This shit volume. Just profit taking and then everyone eats the leftover Christmas dip after the weekend.
Buy baba.
EOD rocket coming for bear asshoe
$0
Cathy don’t chase Chinese bullshit down the rabbit hole please it’s all I want for Xmas 🙏
Do we have after market today?
so predictable at this point
She bought BABA?  Buy, buY? BUY? bUY? BUy? buY?!
Santa’s a power bottom   Spread the rumor
If s&amp;p500 were a parking garage I’d imagine it to be pretty tall, making even high levels still the parking garage. Know what I mean
How can I be happy if I can't watch the lines move.
Do I get into RMG now or nah?
I’m down 20% on ABNB 2/19 115p rn  Should I sell EOD or eat the holidays and see what happens next week?
It went up +70%, what do you expect another +50% lol
Can confirm. Sold too soon, got fucked.
Cramer RT my comment  We in there
I have my last 6k here. What is the lowest risk highest reward play for me? Can not lose it. Im thinking arkg February calls on the dip?
MAKE IT STOP  LET IT END  3 HOURS PUSHED TO THE LIMIT
antitrust lawsuits work out great don’t they, ask Zuffa how they went with theirs lol
Big facts. Especially using data, I like this guy. If I wansn't broke, I'd buy you an award!
What happened to that GME DD yesterday about something big happening today?
Thanks for nothing you pos skateboard
Hello Margin, thank you for your call.  I'm sorry to inform you that I'm out of the office with limited access to my phone and email.  Please leave a message and I'll be sure to return your money at my earliest convenience.
Pltr gets a $32 million contract...down 2%
"You can lead a hoe to water, but you can't make 'em think"  \-Kat Williams
the bottom was 210, you missed the boat
Sq and pton made me more money than my other 100 moves
That’s it?
I'm fearful and you know what they said about fear and greed in the market
RMG up 30% now
what’s the best way i can waste all my christmas money i’ll get tomorrow
BABA, most likely.
pure FD, godspeed
They bailed out GM, Chrysler and Ford.  You’re saying they should have let one of those three fail.  That was your proposal, not mine.
What is gods name happened to WNW
No one knew the potential of Microsoft, or any other service like them. AI has been developing for YEARS to the point its useful NOW. but what do i know, i only got a college degree in this area.
thats the risk you take buying pumps
Buy the dip fellas.
Ydm you got this
nio &amp; crm
SQ can’t even end the day green 🤡
Bruh calls or puts over the long weekend and what stock ??
Actually I was looking at the 17.5 c. It has 3k vol.  Volume is how many contracts gave been sold today.
32 million ain't shit tho
Get up SPY I want cheaper puts for EOD
I bought the dip 5 times in a row. This time it will work.
Wait till Monday, if not then it just wasn’t quite correct
So many people buying a shit company on hopes it can be turned around. lol.
What the fuck happen with the triangle that retards were talking about for pltr???? Fukin technicals
Damn retards really buy Jordan’s for 8x the retail price. Been in the wrong business my whole life apparently
Hmm not a bad idea, just keep the train going
Let GME die already 😩
Made so much money off buying calls when JD dips then shoots up immediately
NIO certain gains.    But More long term.
exactly
Contract smaller than expected
It's simple the more money you lose today the less you can lose next week
FB March 270c bid ask is so whack! 😒😒😒
I'm sure it will pop back up AH once my 0dte calls I bought an hour ago expire.
RMG vote is Monday last chance boys
I know... All you can do is try to imagine you are a normal person
Today -1%  Last month +25%  LMFAO 😂😂
Got all three like a good boy
If you listened to her ark invest seminar a week or 2 ago, she was extremly bullish on china stocks for 2021.
Buying or selling? Price target?
GME gonna run next week no cap
BABA calls are the obvious choice, which is why I’m scared of them 😂
Any interesting plays to buy?
nope owning RKT is worse
You seen the airbb dude ?
I’m saying they should have bailed nobody out. By bailing them out they are picking winners. If they do nothing, the consumers pick who survives via purchases.
It’s still on, waiting for a clear break
If you can’t lose it stop gambling dumbass
The app is actually already under review for both app stores. Not sure if they have anyone reviewing during the holidays so I'm not sure the exact timeline on when the app will be here.
Today was the perfect day for shorts to attack GME but it is only down like 2%.  I know they didn’t give up with that short position. What is their next move?
 Hold the line...12:45 Christmas share pump crew checking in.
Pltr calls 12/31
Lmao
That's the right mindset. Capped my own gains on PLTR puts but it's money
$0 in the past few years
Next moth +25000000%
Yeah thanks.. I didn’t know how to spell the name haha..   What other competition do they have in NYSE?,   Was watching CNBC they put 4 stocks on the screen but I didn’t catch the 4th one
They have 125 clients
Tried to average down my 12/31 DKNG 54s today, rip tendies
Nah I just buy real companies
Today’s been a pretty shit day for me
I mean I'm interested to learn. I just have tried to research the company and the descriptions always sound so vague. I would like to understand it better.
S&amp;p is a big hotel. The parking is in the basement. Let’s say it has 100 floors. We are probably on floor 94 right now and need to get to floor 70. Obviously not going to the garage because we don’t need to leave the hotel, but need to go back to 70 because they need to do construction on the upper floors so we can keep going higher. What I’m trying to say is, well, we need a correction.
Why?
Relying on technicals is dumb.
💎✋
anyone here in rds.b or bp?
Bought my nephew a $60 gift card. Bought my daughter a game in August. $120 spent in 2020.
Is fedex in a recession wtf man
Was reading up on VS PR now I really want a facial
u next
Looking at the menu and the FCEL 1/15 13c looks tasty
It’s come to this
Sounds good. The market cap is so low.  Peanuts these days
Cash me outside
STIC 🐶
Not over yet
Buy the XL dip
It was sub 10 like a week ago, I've read a few DD's that explain that their Hydrogen batteries aren't exactly feasible but it's been doing really well so who knows
same
The same Cathie Wood who took money out of TSLA in November right before its huge month of gains and put it into BABA right before its earnings crash
Sorry I’ve been helping my parents with shit all morning, but what’s going on with BABA today?
So we are saying AAPL has been developing an EV ready to sell in 2024 while being fucking profitable all these years? So profitable that nobody even noticed the extreme investments such projects take? It true, this may be the greatest company in the history of companies.
Been in since $11. Holding.
It fucking better or I’m deleting robinhood
Sounds just retarded enough to work
NVDA is the 💎
GOT IT CALLS ON YDM
Last chance before BABA rockets
New hiking boots
What do you think the average net worth was?
Fuck you Dorsey way to focus!
Pltr load up 👌
Cant believe CRSR was at 44 just a few days ago
Run to $12 before the next leg up to $30
Holy shit! I have like 10 followers on Twitter and one of them is Marcus Lemonis. Why is this guy following me LOL.
Supply and demand, good luck going crazy hitting the check out button
Lol as per usual, you could roll them to next week and hope the stimmy passes Monday and bumps the market up
Not really. You need state of the art bots that cost lots of money or need to be a good programmer to write them yourself for you to cop Jordans that will 8x their retail price.
You will stop hearing about it shortly after it stabilizes at $50
Why is CRSR such a bipolar bitch
Amd pleas fly again
When a girl buys a vibrator, it’s seen as a bit of naughty fun, but when I buy myself a 240 Volt FuckMaster Pro 5000 blowup latex doll with 6 speed pulsating vagina, elasticized anus with non-drip semen collection tray, with optional built in realistic orgasm scream sound system for Christmas, I’m called a pervert.

at what point are the contracts big though? that's a massive fucking contract. thought it was going to moon 20%
Long weekend anyway fuck it threw 1k in
Do you ever feel like you make your best trades while pooping?
u mean grand pooba of antifa?
I'm looking at 530c March and 550 June.  I'm planning to sell some (not all) on the catalysts and switch to day trade weeklies.  Jensen will guide us to Valhalla.
I know and that’s what scares me 😬
The real logistics trade is $UHAL - since I see UPS renting trucks from them for holiday season
Yes, buy the ones i just sold. 32c 12/31
I was told to buy high
They need to cover today because it'll be the 13th day that GME is on the threshold list.   Clearing houses might force them to cover their positions for failing to borrow. Combined with a random positive headline, this could very well lead to a mini short squeeze come Monday, similar to what we saw in October.   In fact, it might be conducive to buy weekly calls for once.
Imagine being cash gang this week and not yoloing into SPAC’s.
So what we betting 700 TSLA  before 1/1??
Gotcha. My calls are far out so no biggie but just wondering. Thanks man
Gains are gains. I could have made an easy $5k this month but got assigned. Haven’t lost sleep.
oh man i wouldnt have bought puts on baba
They have so much cash on hand it would be wild if they weren’t making long shot plays like that
#Santa baby, just slip a 💰 under the tree for me
Na
If it trades like a penny stock, TA doesn't matter much.
About 10% of my portfolio is RDSA (from Netherland hence the reason I got RDSA and not RDSB)
LOL
all in BABA leaps
I heard Krampus is really Trevor Milton.
MT is about to get bigly, hop into the spaceship now or else
BABA
Can you guys stop selling CRSR? Thanks

If GME ends above 20.5 today I will cum
God i am broke
I suspect it is being propped up by the uptick rule, let's see how Monday goes.
Literally free money. This is like buying AMZN in 2008.
I'm fighting for my life out here
China anti-monopoly probe.
So...want to place bets on how much longer Jack Ma has before he disappears?
Baba gonna rip in Jan...lockdown 3.0
Hehe, republicans gon' lose GA
I am! Just waiting for the right entry today, when do you think?
If I didn't add any equity to the play I would have to move up $5 in strike. Not a bad play, especially if I waited a few more weeks.
17mins till market close. What to buy what to buy 👀
Im pretty sure their one goal is exec compensation with Sherman.
Which fund did she add baba to?
That’s cuz it’s you vs skynet
No lol it’s going to trade sideways, look at those candles
Black people investing in shoes   And white people investing in the stock market
That's a dying industry my man. They are only putting 2% of their budgets towards developing renewables. Not something I want to touch long term.
Silver
That's nothing on JKS or DQ over the last few days.
to short more and drive the price down, because nobody actually wants to hold GME long term.
What dip do I buy
“You should close the position if you won’t take that position now”  Fuck it, when I opened it it wasn’t -60%
Can’t even enjoy my Christmas because of CRSR
Under 11 is a mf steal. With a $10 floor it’s one of the safest gambles out here IMO.
That's what the institions are deciding, depending on if they want uppies or downies on the day 🤗
Reminds me of the scene in Indiana Jones where the big dude with the even bigger sword comes out swinging it around in a skillful, complex manner.  IJ looks at him unimpressed, casually lifts his pistol and fires at dude, then walks off.
BABA dip is free money guys. It basically like the FB dip during the spring, expect a V shaped recovery.  Anti-christ Supreme commie leader Winnie the Pooh just dumped America bulls a Christmas gift.
Looks like the Vaccine trial results were "fake". Numerous severe "Reactions" being reported by Healthcare workers.   Puts on 2021.
sir, this is wsb
13 stocks why
Welcome to the WSB holiday party! Feel free to try the dips but the xl dip smells a little fishy to me.
If /u/DEEPFUCKINGVALUE is still in were still in.
Had to sell my AMD weeklies to buy into baba
Just bought Amzn 5000 leaps. Am I retarded?
NIO
Something about ipos and shares. But there’s no way it stays sub 4 billion market cap when everyone and their mother wants to be a streamer now a days
DoorDash with only about 8% of its average daily volume so far. Roughly 16% of the typical volume if you account for the half trading day.  Very strange
I have put in an order but the bid ask is whack.  Reminder, last 20 minutes left
inshallah
Today is a massacre day. Especially for AAPL. So lucky i got out at that pump. Thinking of re-entering Calls again tho at a cheaper price.
This made me laugh
Whaaaaa?? Do I have a source on this?
Buy calls right now or wait for Monday?  April ICLN
RMG’s been taking off 🚀
 I did. Then I did again. Then again. :}
Trust in Cathy she knows what she’s doing 🚀🚀🚀
But that is not what you said.  The problem here is you’re basing an argument based on absence of facts.  Regardless, if you really think they shouldn’t interfere in any business then you’re asserting they should remove all tax credits and small business incentives.  Let the consumers decide right?  You can’t have it both ways.
It’s kind of true but don’t say that :/ there are smart black investors too, I wish as a people they become more educated and level up in love also.

WHY IS NIO DOWN SO MUCH? MAKES NO FUCKING SENSE
\#doublestandard
AAPL 01/15 140C
if this happens, spy puts, tech stock puts, a demo mandate will cause some panic. biden could pass tax reform
Palantears 😢😭
Life*
MT DD all says that it isn't supposed to start popping off until December and January. Most have been buying March and June calls. Plenty of time
Good point.  Setting a limit buy at $18
Yikes gme

How dumb would 2022 or 2023 LEAPS on cruise lines be?

I'd bet he doesn't.
Thank you! I got 235 shares and a Call 3/19/21 Hope this hits.  🚀 I’m new here btw
About to buy FEYE 30C LEAP on the toilet as we speak 🤔🚽
BABA $230 EOD?
Then leave the casino
Would love to see PLTR end the day under 27 again.
$BABA segment coming up on CNBC - FYI since half of you degens trade that CCP shit
You, like the congress people who represent you, can easily name Ford Chrysler and GM, but what about the thousands of business you can’t name, that aren’t big enough for congress people to care about because they don’t donate millions to their campaigns. Where do their tax dollars go? To bailout a company, while their own company fails? It’s insanity. Nobody is deserving of a bailout. Especially not big business.
Source?
So BABA puts?
Throw it all into SRAC Warrants and dream again
I’m holding off on options. You get 4 days of theta burn before Monday.
MGNI gettin it.
is spy gonna pull the same shit it did yesterday at close?
PLTR still the move?
not before we tells us how much he loves XIe   watch his eyes for the blinking morse code
Baba looking like a steal... china really gonna gut their crown gem?
haha yes let's move the goalposts
Bro the fuck master pro is a gift from the heavens
Am I buying this fubo dip or what? You guys tell me

 If you like BABA I think you have to do it with deep in the money calls right here.. .i would like another day to assess...    https://twitter.com/jimcramer/status/1342163192944930817?s=20
They're already worthless. But they were very cheap anyway and I still have Feb calls. I only picked these up as lottos when I saw today's dip.

PLTR DD recap (Serious) for those who missed it! (Gay mods removed first post...)  Hi guys first off I'll keep it fast and simple cause some are retards some autistic.   Since Cramer recognizes WSB, we have as much to say as Credit Gay and Shitron. WSB analyst ANAL KING price target for PLTR 42$+ for 2021. This is not financial advice, do your own DD. This is for autism purposes only. Invest at your own risk.  This is a former DD post from u/Felsommer so all credit to him! :  https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/keu3ca/pltr_will_moon_soon_i_got_proof/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share  Next the 1H must watch video on PLTR :  https://youtu.be/_0i9XU3MA7s  And a last one Alex Karp saying PLTR will be the most important software company in the world :  https://youtu.be/6loNXj3LSaw  Now I could add way more, like all the clients they already have etc...etc... so also do some research!  TLDR - All in PLTR
Ur all bark no bite
Man they hyped that triangle up.

Manipulated to expire low. Will take off esp in January
updated with link.
Buy the dip. Just reenter at 36.30 x 1200 shares.
funny that some of y'all are freakin out about GME being down 2.5% after being up &gt;33% on the week but in reality i'm super bullish seeing it hold $20, very excited to see whats in store for next week.
It's going to rocket all the way to +3% YTD.  Seriously,  look at the ytd return.   Shit stonk
AAPL is literally green what
Buy the dip. Even if you can call this the dip.
Damn I originally thought this said from touching nba. I was gonna tell you to fade the clippers tomorrow

You guys loading up on anything shares wise before the weekend?
Probably quite low. Cathie said they'll expect something like 20+% from the next year.
Lol do it
I hope during the last month of his presidency uncle Donny just starts firing off random stock tickers with an emoji just to completely shake up the market. GME 👀 TSLA 🐐 AMZN 🤮
[removed]
That's what the dude who did triangles. He said it will gonna take off this week
That is literally what I said. The government shouldn’t pick winners and losers. The consumer should via purchases. As far as tax credits, like I said previously, the tax rates are to fund a budget of 1.5T+ per year. I would want the government operating on 500b or less. And yeah, you can remove all tax incentives after cutting the amount of tax you need to collect into a third of what it currently is. Why would the government need to maintain the same tax revenue if I’m proposing they do absolutely nothing to interfere in the market? They obviously wouldn’t.
Baby rocketing to 230 end of day
why'd you buy into baba? Or buy AMD weeklies, you'd be better off buying amd 2022 calls

Someone change my flair AMD is ded to me
Averaged a little on Baba at $213
CLOSE THE DOOR, STOP THE COUNT, TURN THE FUCKIN SHIT OFF
i've been hovering pretty much around -0.5% on the day with one spike down at open and one huge spike up immediately after before settling at this boring level. i guess arbitrarily a win will be closing green, a lose will be closing lower than -1.0%
Pump you lousy bitch
well.. they're from Ohio
I hate this market so fucking much. It's literally designed to steal my money no matter what I do.
No I bought the exact middle price. The Vega on it is $38 which Is wild. Probably should have made note of that first.
What is a ticker\\gang you learned not to fuck around with in 2020?  I'll go first: TNKR.
Fucking BABA, what a scam. Everything in china is a scam
Why is everyone complaining? These cheap prices ARE the Christmas gift.
Exactly, was just cash I wasn’t using so we’ll see where it takes us
Fuck your pump and dump just buy spy bro
spy puts are the move right?
giant green dildos coming like heat-seeking missiles for bear asshoe into the close

Bought the BABA dip a little too early but with this bounce I’m green, gonna hold and hope CCP doesn’t fuck me further
Making millions too
Is Jack Ma still alive?!!!!
Thinking about going long on XL with the citron valuation
Buy 2023 SPY leaps near the money. Buy 2023 AAPL leaps near the money. You won't have to wait until 2023.
This dip for baba was so exaggerated buy the dip retards
Took the L on Dash. IV was just killing my puts, not worth it to go in it until at least after the lockup period

Same, I was thinking we might have a larger slide today. Pleasantly surprised to see it hold so steady.
Shit ran up 100% in 2 days and has pulled back 15% but buy the dip 😂
Don’t gamble bro. Make your own decision and be confident in it.
You couldn’t even name Chrysler or Ford.   You’re all suggesting small businesses do not receive any help at all (see PPP).  Anecdotally I know a lot of small businesses that took advantage of it, and that’s fine.  I’m not the one who has an issue with that.
Damn, that makes me sad
APPL is still down if you considered yesterday. And honestly if I hadn’t got out my contracts would have lost 15% of its value easily. But it’s holding decently well, so I might re-enter
12:58
Epic big chungus rally coming next week?
Flattest day ever
IF U AINT BUYIN NGA U AINT BLACK........ and u racist
Bot more $PLTR calls here.
Probably vipshop. I don't know much about this one at all tbh- but it could be a real sleeper. Will have to look into this one.
Yep. 1.5 month long bull flag with declining volume. It’s gonna wreck 2021. I wouldn’t short it with your money.
Short squeeze may happen, but trying to pick the exact time it will happen is pretty fucking hopeful.  You need to assess your conviction levels on a post like that.
ya right, you wont see 220 ever again
SKLZ dipping
Imagine not buying the baba dip  Cathie Wood, Ray Dalio, &amp; the CCP are loading up cheap

dont like seeing red lol
so, drill then flat to close. nice little xmas fuck you
This is the way
seems like a good hedge against a long american recovery
Was thinking of buying a baba put but realized that time was last week latest. Bought 2/19 210c. Worse case scenario it crashes into a Ma Bell situation but unlikely.

Any CBD recommendations?
This is why giving finance advice is hell. If it goes down they blame you, if it goes up they want more. And I'm pretty guilty of this as well
MSFT keeping me alive today
You'll see
What ever happened to the brexit deal? Thought that was today...?
last 10 min pump lets go
Totally agreed.  Holding $20 when the last time it had a run up it didn't hold $17ish.  Sentiment on the ticker has gone up, plenty of catalysts upcoming, and people are still FOMOing in and out.  What anyone does with their money is up to them, but I'm about them shares and long calls.
Bruh it’s cool off, over sold rn
BABA rise from the ashes!!!
[removed]
Bruh this market is so manipulated 😂
Anything I should get before the close?  Opened my first PLTR today  Looking for one more
So much sad
Really does, retards blaming him for buying BABA
MERRY 🎄
At this point I'm convinced anytime I buy it'll go down
It’s Christmas boys here’s the presents
BABA  MERRY CHRISTMAS
Today has been fake and ghey.
Like clockwork, DKNG flies too close to $55 and dumps.

If you didn’t buy this MVIS dip you most certainly are not black

If you think BABA is going to go up, buy calls. If you think BABA is going to go down, buy puts. If you think anybody in here is going to give you any valuable information about BABA, buy a first class ticket to a mental institution.   12/31 230c
Need a last minute buy for shares $700, thinking of just a averaging up my BFT position

If you didn’t expect a pullback after and 80 percent run up yesterday you’re retarded
Xilinx, not NVDA.   &amp;#x200B;  It's a free 10% with the acquisition, then you ride AMD's 2021 stock to 120+
CCP is rich beyong ur imagination already boyo.
Haven't you been paying attention recently? He literally only cares about his criminal friends
Fuck you MMS manipulating GME price to avoid shaving to close shorts by today’s deadline
Good call, they’re on discount right now
Nice! Looking to up my gambling game, this sounds great

Merry Christmas and diversify

Merry spacmas everyone
BABA 2022 leaps anyone?
Can’t drive a lambo if you’re retarded 🥊
Buy and hold baby, buy and hold
Inverse of course
This is the kind of weak ass pump with the sole purpose of trying to get us to hold heavy bags. Not buying it.
who still holding GME calls?
That’s right. Long term baby.
oof
I got wrecked today
I've not found any place that takes tax deductions as legal tender
there's always a bull market somewhere
bleeding
8 minutes to buy your FDs! I’m selling $AAPL calls and $TNA puts! Hot ‘n’ Ready!
Ok? I do have an issue with it, the money disproportionately goes to larger companies because larger companies qualified for larger loans. Instead of taxing people and giving their money away to someone else, let people keep more of their money, which they can choose to spend wherever they want. Which is allowing CONSUMERS to decide winners and losers, as opposed to letting the government decide winners and losers by choosing who gets how much bailout money.
i didnt realise plastic was going anywhere. lol  they are bouncing back and will adapt to be clean energy businesses
Got in @ $255 got a long way to go for me GUH
Baba
im thinkin of gettin in but seeing all these bagholders sellin so quickly and sharply cause pooh and the gang are investigating makes me xtra cautious
Bought them ofc yesterday lmfao
I already did in the past with zero success. The last time I bought SPY leaps, we were down -8% in the next 2 weeks and the last time I bought AAPL leaps, it was flat for the next 2 months and I got IV crashed.
All major indexes green.    Pretty much everything I own is bleeding.    🤣
BABA dip gone just like that
R M G is Godly
Facts
Greedy fuck
Approved
Boy, RKT is a real piece of shit.
Bought some GME shares in case we see some good action Monday.
I will keep this in mind &amp; will definitely BTFD. Panic can't last too long once everyone realizes printer still go brrrrr and maybe more so with a dem mandate
I think Im the only one who can lose money on SQ calls 2 times in a row
GME 20.21 eod

You good?”  “Sure but let’s give the people like 5 or 6 hundred bucks, and then we can just point the finger at each other and say that this was the best we can do”  “Sounds good, I’m going home for the holidays.  Merry Christmas, assholes.  I’ll call y’all from one of my vacation homes or some rich fuckers yacht”
come on palantir you fucking cocksucker
Made back some of my BABA losses from the bottom, -3.7K more to go
Merry Christmas MFs
Tsla
AI, they're currently dipping. But their stock will most likely double in the next year.
There goes another paycheck
Merry Christmas everyone 🎄
Hold the loooiiinnee
I agree. Might liquidate some shares for a few of those spreads!
Oof
BABA going up but my calls are going down. IV “crush?” They’re five months out
Get in on NVDA and Wayfair calls. Such dips don’t come often! 😎😎😎
OOF
Someone convince me to not buy 8k of GME shares
Spent mystical stimmy on aapl 1/21/2022 185 call
should be on god
Lol where have YOU been the last three months
You can’t maintain a yacht if you’re retarded ⛵️
Still holding 2 12/31 13c
Ur talking to the guy who sold CRSR 30c 1 day into nov rally
Oof, portfolio looks pretty shite right now, but I picked up some cheapies today, hopefully we rally monday
Ok maybe AMZN isn’t the call EOD
I see almost everything as red, bit confused honestly
APPL was pumping nicely at the start then it all went downhill and it literally stays flat when with the huge SPY green dildo like a minute ago bro
Pltr?
Any gains I make go right into more plays until 0. This is the way right ? I don’t think I have a cash out option
Ffs Idk what I expected. Happens every time I go all in on puts. Next time I want to do that I need to inverse myself but then it’ll probably finally dump
I hate how my sold puts show red on my portfolio, even though they are still above the strike.  I get why, I just don't like it.
It's up from yesterday's open as well, what are you smoking. Up 2% last week overall. Up 13% last month. Excellent performance all around. Would have made money on any AAPL calls other than weeklies, LOL
Well rode BABA Calls up for 20%, I don't have more conviction in BABA than this. Sold em before close.  Let's see how I feel about my paperhands Monday lol.
Are you not aware there's literally a whole culture genre poking at the fact that people jumping off the bridge on Xmas or Xmas Eve due to unfortunate circumstances, usually revolving around finance? No one is telling anyone to jump, just alluding to that. But I see that you clearly didn't get it.
What’s carrying this EOD rally?
Reminder markets close in 7 minutes
XL $40c here
NVDA should buy Tidal instead of SQ imo. That way they can use their super machine learning to fix the recommendation algos and beat SPOT at their own game.
yeah that makes sense. im thinking about a similar weight for my 401k
If you pussies stopped selling we would be green
pence won’t do it
Got burned by baba calls so bought shares becuz i am a bitch
Calls on Arkham Asylum
VIX pricing is always bullshit. Lots of space to play tricks. Tried to sell put spread at 400 and sat there unfilled for 2 hours. Then I raised price to 600 and it gets immediately filled. Why would this happen?
Same here, pretty much across the board
It's only money man
You too bitch
RKT ticker is a setup for a P\D IMO. Bout as bad as NKLA.
what if big pharm crushed up remdesivir and diluted it with water and called it a vaccine? 😂
IV on these BABA calls are fucked
election is on 1/5
Convinced
Seems smart to me

hmmmm i kinda wanna get a spy 420c 1/2022 for the meme
Buy buy buy!!!
PLTR and GME are both down today  Should I sack up and finally jump in both y/n
How long is the dark going to last?
Pinned under $50. If it can break and hold, I’ll buy some calls for nio day.
Stimulus delayed I assume which means plenty of stimulus talks going well news to pump the market.
ARKG being down is my fault, I bought shares yesterday.
Fuck everything else, at least I still have my 🐝
SPYYYYYY YESSS   SANTA IS REAL!!! 🎅 🛷 🎁 🎄

Oh then you’re straight lol. More so talking about the January calls.
Bought a thousand shares of rycey for entertainment purposes. Up almost 7% today.

Fuck this gay earth
What time AH ends??
👋 how about Americans get the money and not politicians &amp; the rest of the world genius. Did they tell you about the 25m raise for congress? Did they tell you 60% goes to other countries (which funnels back to politicians)? Educate yourself
The 30$ resistance is so strong, it never hits. Hopefully by new year
Fucking same. Down 1700 on TME calls
Loaded up on weeklies.
Notice that Apple Maps gives you a real full 3D view of some cities. It’s not just spheres of 3D like google street view. This means they have cars driving around mapping with LIDAR....

Not really, sorry, I usually go for THC heavy vape carts  But you should check Leafly, it's kind of like the GlassDoor of the dispensary world
True, true. Probably a bumpy ride from here to the end of January either way.
I opened more positions today, seems like strong odds they rebound
If I get one more, "Alibaba is suffering 18% drop..."
Gme will never squeeze because you pussies keep selling.
Alexa set alarm for 12:59
Fossil fuels will never be clean energy. And their yearly spending shows that they are still all in on fossil fuels. Plastic production will most likely see a slowdown eventually as well as more countries ban plastic bags and companies cut down on plastic packaging.

Okay I'm gonna mention this stock one more time. PRCH, it was a spac called PTAC that just changed ticker today. This is the next LMND. Screenshot this post and check the price 3 weeks from now. Bet.
Warp Speed Covid Vaccine.. What could go wrong???  Oh SHIT....   PUTS on MRNA, PFE, AZN
Stop the count!
We close in 5 mins buddy
Right when I think I’m out, BABA pulls me back in 😤😤
BABA calls last chance boys. Will open 240 monday
Up 1k for the day
I like the longer term plays of PLTR - but the option premiums are too high - so I'd look at the stock.
How the fuck can you not buy $BABA? Literally free money!!!! Wtf man we make money here this shit is Amazon “Made In China” version with their own e-commerce and cloud computing.  EVERYONE PUMP THIS SHIT, WSB HEDGEFUND READY TO TAKE A STAKE ON ALIBABA ($BABA)!!!
Incredible, besides Cohen reshaping the company this Microsoft revenue sharing deal with GameStop is a lot bigger than you think, game stop having the market cap at 1.4billion is just a fraction of what it’s suppose to be. Twisting that knife into Melvin capital and BofA is so bitter sweet.
Shit man, I don’t think the pump even happened.    Straight out the gate on Monday it went down.  I mean, we’re talking Electric vehicle AND skateboard technology.  Together.    The future is now.
Playing long. I'll take some sideways for a bit if necessary.
They do be surviving.
Baba was red for the year earlier today that is hilarious
[deleted]
Just remember. BABA had a record sale few weeks ago on their version of Black Friday.   Their revenue target for 2021 is $106 Billion, which is 49%+ from 2020. Come February earnings, it will be back up. Probably wont breach $300 until they resolve the situation with Xi but their core business is booming amidst this turmoil with the government.
It’s everyone’s fault bud
What I’m saying the point of the government is to help support any and all businesses.  Remember when Donnie started a trade war with China then subsequently had to bail out farmers?  You saying he shouldn’t have done that either?  Operating a government on 500b or less isn’t feasible.  Have you looked at the budget lately?  Hell I think the military spends that alone.
PLTR yes, this is a decent consolidation phase and the news flow for them has been exceedingly positive lately  GME no...it's up like fucking 35% in 2 days lol
Nothing lasts forever my friend
Yes
Bought more today
Pharmabro's never lie
Trust in Cathy bro. I bought ARKK today.
RMG gets approved Monday last chance to buy in!
More I fiddle or overthink more I lose, badly. My shitty Roth is up 20% just dartboarding and leaving alone. As for the rest guess I'm claiming losses for a third year now, fuck.
#Every time a bell rings an angel gets his wings   #Merry Christmas gay bois
did CRSR get some bad news or is it just a dip
 More 1500 GME shares! Let’s go Santa
I got in at PLTR at 25.90 so even tho it’s down today it’s still offsetting my losses I’m currently at like +1% for the day it’s been rough was up like 15% 2 days ago but it’ll all be Gucci by January... just glad I don’t buy options at the moment
What happened with the vaccine?
This is... *advanced retardation* 😳
a lotttt of eyeballs will be watching BABA AH and monday premarket.   I think it continues to fall just from predatory shorts. I will go long if things look ridiculous on Monday morning
Well I got fucked harder than I’ve ever been fucked today
Went full retard and got BABA 4/16 300C
Bro they don’t want 27$ Jan 22 calls I’m selling good luck
Rmg boutta tank at ticker change. Y’all got played
When do they open again? Monday or Tuesday?
Little BABA bleed off ahead of market close.
thank you for giving me hope
Who knew refusing to sign a budget and delaying stimulus was so bullish?
Cathie was killed by the Grinch
Dip
It’s trading in the same range it been in all month.
How much of that is xi taking
You don’t need to be warren fuckin buffet to know that PLTR is a literal exit scam, stay triggered soyboys
The highway is paved with people who spammed 🚀🚀and had 💎💎👋👋

Down 5K. You guys?
Portfolio down 20% the past two days so my cock is rock hard
How do y’all feel about AMD in July?
To the people who bought my BABA puts, thank you!!
Loaded BABA to the tits. Lmao people paying 100pe for AMZN with literally EVERYTHING from BABA, but 25 for BABA. Even with commie risk 75% discount? LOL
I agree... but there’s no way BABA should have been down 17% earlier.. any intelligent investor should have realized and bought the dip
low brow content, imo. do you player.
So that’s why it’s called a broker
Done 😎 back to GME brother
Spy puts?
No thanks
PSTH?
Ayy ton
Huge hulk dildo on PRPL. Ho ho ho
Not dumb, we've dipped over 15% since weekend high. Should be only up from here. I'd buy some $45 february
Good idea, just did the same...

Ain’t worth shit if China takes over the boat with their sadistic ways. That’s called a wrecking ball bud. No one gives a shit about cash flow, profit, or anything when a dictator is running the show
PLEASE LET THE RECORD SHOW I DID NOT CONSENT

Fuck you nio
Do we expect some gme shorts to cover b4 new years? 1300 shares and 25C holding strong!! 🙏💪💪
im eating qdoba right now
seriously, i drank so much GME kool aid I didnt dare sell my GME shares/calls for baba calls had to scalp from other positions
SPY implied volatility for January 4th: 15  SPY implied volatility for January 6th: 20  VIX: 21  Which means VIX will drop down to 15 soon after Georgia elections. Good shorting opportunity.
You know how some people make millions trading only 1 ticker , it looks like AMD is my ticker
people buying beds for xmas?
Meh $800
Psth
Don’t doubt your vibe and panic sell.  I know some here needs to hear this.  It’s a low volume short trading day
Puts on you.

I'll never forgive BofA for that overdraft fee 15 years ago.
Quick-last minute plays??!
Up 50 :)))))
maybe take a quick peep at the last BABA bad CCP news drill sesh  this can go a fair bit lower still
Depends on who is buying
Probably?  There is currently 2 minutes left in the trading day.  It wasn't right.
fuck CRSR, all my homies hate CRSR
When is change
straight cash homie, up a bit from BA bounces this morning.   you have to be insane to hold plays overnight at these levels. only intraday feels safe to me.
Ready for santa rally 100% balls deep in GME, NIO, PLTR, ARKG, and VLDR.
Not a chance. Easier to control it— put proxy gov agents on the board. I’m not sure why no one seems to say that it’s so much easier to take more control than dismantle. They want state champions. They just want to make them STATE-champions.
If Apple goes to $140 its market cap will grow by 150billion which is extremely unlikely.
up like $200
Damn 2k+ volume on amzn 3750 puts next week ...
How
Buy ARKK they said
Bruh like 3 min
Corsair gaming monthly calls
WSB shitting their pants on BABA. Just wait until more institutions unload 😂 we’re seeing sub 200s soon
oooh not enough time. id roll into late 2021 or early 2022. CCP doesn't mess around. They're making an example of BABA and are gonna keep the pressure on for quite a while.
up only bc FUBO other than that i’d be rekt
PASS THE BILL.   TRUMP LEFT FOR XMAS. ITS A POCKET VETO  GOP JUST FUCKED AMERICA
I just bought some for 270 - 285. Think we have a good monday to look forward to!
Future bagholders need a solid matteress when the market makers fuck them next year
It’s gonna take more than that to shake me out
Does that zoom email thing have any merit
 BABA black sheep have you any wool?
Bought pltr
Did Twitter kill a man or something? 🤦‍♂️
Smells like **BITCHMAS** in here
Merry christmas

Why is stonk go down when stonk only go up
28th. Good time to get a few 1/15 puts as lottos
LOL
I bought 1/29
I need in on that to ruin that too
Haha same, I sold 200p, 210p, and 220p for about $1k in premium (all 12/31)  Covered on all of them already except the 200p.  Gotta love the bears, they are so retarded they hurt themselves in confusion and just scramble to buy puts at any price
if you hold long, BABA will be bigger than AMZN one day
Bought arkg and arkk on these dips
Only think you’ll be jerking off into is a used cumsock, which is all you can afford after GME moons
Is NIO calls at close the move?
Monday
White people invest in giant tires and lifted suspension for their trucks.

Shitty fucking Christmas
BABA 🚨 🚨🚨🚨
I got a puffy
Commie risk, plus AWS retard
Just threw $100 at it. Let’s see if you’re right
Sometimes you make a bit of money and sometimes you lose it all. I definitely liked your play, it made sense
My one leap NVDA leap hopes you’re right
GME is going to rip on Monday and Tuesday, get in fuckers we are going to the moon!
Santa told me to hold this -25k L over the holidays. Merry Christmas, and fuck you Santa.
Calls on cotton...you know, for all the straight jackets that'll be needed
🤢
Getting sick of this dance PLTR
Never bet against tesla
Expecting PLTR to be around 24 by then
Last time doesn’t exist in today’s market, jack wl settle it over the weekend end baba will open at 240
Bad move, Christmas cheer will continue into Monday, wait til it clears 370 at least
50 big ones? I bet you believe in Santa again.
I'm sure they found ALL the cases. LOL
I wouldn’t either
Up 25k
If you bought 2 years out, why do you care that it went down 8% in a week? That's nothing. And even with the 2 months IV crush, you got 2 years man. If you bought near the money you should be fine. Give it at least 8 months to a year, or be down &gt;50% before giving up on it!
Faith
Have already lost 3k trying to do this. You can give it a go but be warned that volume has been very low. Very easy for MM to pump only a couple thousand shares to keep price higher than strike price.
Power 5 minutes
I swear PLTR is just staying pinned under 30 until all options expire worthless. MM are fuk
How cool is this pump knowing good and well that bill isn’t getting passed today and likely getting vetoed before Monday. 🤡
This Christmas I wish Santa rims RH’s asshole sooo hard so it stops with the 1d old news that keep coming back
I'm never opening robinhood again.  So 3k is my maximum loss
There’s still time
Buy BABA NOW TRUST 🚨🚨🚀🚀🚀🚨🚨
   18-24: .00001096567  45-54: .00034554211  over 85: 0.01404354123  oops, imma leave this here
Good time to buy GME?
3750?
DKNG seems especially sensitive to sell barriers and it sometimes takes a couple days to run back up.  Think people are missing out on the run through Feb though.
No news, just pure manipulation
ADD Some XPEV in the side and I’m balls deep in with you bro! #nohomo
Haha I'm up $161 (0.0%) dollars today.
Wayfair has started closing their brick and mortar stores...
All analysis predict $300 plus for 2021... one shitty news about lawsuits isn’t going to change that
NIO ARKG and BABA calls  🚀  🚀  🚀  ill see you all in tendie town in a month
Just joined pltr with you all
Yup
You cant short the vix. You can long puts or short calls.
Alright so who else bought that BABA dip 🤚
Losing $100 makes you hard?
Let’s go mvis
Bought 275 shares today. Lets see what happens.
Baba $250
Well that was fucking brutal
Yep
doubled down on the dip for my calls
Lmfao Xpeng at 42 really?? This market is so over dramatic I love it. Guess that’s the free money play then right now. Calls and DCA it is thank you paper hands
Ofc MU pumping at close after I get out
Just clench your butt cheeks, buy TSLA leaps and believe in your messiah Elon Musk
Real men bought the BABA dip , gay frogs was playing with penny stocks / GME / PLTR / spacs
I’m up lol. Bought BABA calls at 217
stock price is too high imo
All I want for christmas is AMD to go back up to $98
STOP THE COUNT
Wont happen. China wants their version of GOOG, AAPL, MSFT in the world stage. The government wants that.   So stop with the fear mongering. Name a single company that Xi’s government tore apart with BABA’s size. You can’t. All they have done is to fuel the growth of mega companies and they will continue to so.  Unless Xi plans on kidnapping Jack Ma and make him disappear, BABA will be BABA
Merry Christmas!    My ass hurts from today! 🥳🎅
Thats it. Spent all my money on the dip.  PLTR, GME, BABA, AI, FUSE, XL  basically the same thing that keeps dragging me down.
PENISES DOWN MERRY CHRISTMAS FUCKERS!!!
Bull gang rise up
What does that even mean
I’m jacked to the tits going into this weekend
Get the cucking of a lifetime if there’s another slide
Oof that IV and low volume on what I thought was discount calls on BABA
✏️ dicks down!
Merry Christmas, ya filthy animals...
Took the fattest L this last three hours 🥴🥴🥴🥴
Thanks
Just get ass railed by everything I touch

I bet the people selling Xpeng in the 40s are the same dummies who bought at the top
#Pencils down

Anyone think BABA 12/31 250c still possible?
do not do this then
the wick on baba's candle has convinced me to buy in  wheeee
did the opposite haha
New bill will be passed in Jan 2021 that will propel all green energy stocks. I will make a DD post about it, but for now get Panasonic, SunRun, and SunPower stocks. They are going to the moon in January
Interesting close

Nice
Ended green marginally LOL
Somehow I ended green today. +23.84
Who ever swung baba calls with me ✌🏻We eating steak on Monday . I REPEAT BABA WILL OPEN AT $260 Monday

Call the ambulance, but not for me
my 5 mins BABA fds didn't work lol
Guys... I’d love to tell you to hop in easy wins next week like FCEL, FUBO, MGNI, and plug.  But come on.. these are the easiest run ups to $20 you’ll ever see   **G H I V**   **I P O C**
cant explain that
MERRY FUCKING CHRISTMAS RETARDS
holy fuck these are some ugly buys  except BABA tho probably
It’s such a weird feeling to have your trading day end at 8am :/
Same. Cash gang didn’t last long. YOLO
I understand what you’re saying, I also care about people and business’ but frankly I’m not convinced the government is best at that. The government, the way its set up, is always going to give more of the benefits to their donors, and friends, so the small guy will get left out. Better to allow the market decide then the government, more fair, more efficient.  I do remember that, I disagree with those bailouts as well. What is a bailout? They take our taxpayer money and give it to the farmer right, so, why not, we just keep our money, and the farmers charge more for their product, and we pay more.   Because the military is global, operating in multiple wars all over the world at any given time. Ever listen to Eisenhower’s speech on the military industrial complex? It’s a good listen.
Took a giant shit after watching BABA today. Puts on my anal health
position or go fuck yourself
Had 2k cash left and used it on baba dont feel great about it
Not even letting it stay over 29.  27-28 just stuck in the mud
...and ARKG
Time to sit under the Xmas tree doing nothing until Monday
Yeah that tax scheme was proposed before and the problem is the tax revenue wouldn’t cover spending and would result in larger deficit, inflation, or unproductively increase sales tax.  Again you can’t run a government on 500b or less.
Thank god it closed early, all i saw today was a continuous bleed down in my portfolio
Redistribute some profits to homeless people if you can. I feel so bad for these these bastards, it’s fucking freezing in the midwest
Yeah fuck today. Have a good weekend y’all.
EVERYTHING HALTED?!
Casino is closed you phaggots. Go enjoy Christmas with your wives and their boyfriends and I’ll see you degenerates Monday morning.
Buy MSFT 🤓🤓🤓🤓
If you look at PLTR’s one month chart you can see a giant wedge forming, likely 1-2 weeks of slight downward movement and then we’re flying.
what about $TAN?
Thank me later guys. Just bought some SQQQ 12/31 17c and VXX 12/31 18c. Ain't no dip coming before new years eve!
PLTR to the earth...
Down 3.5 percent today womp womp
Lesson learned.
That end of day green candle is good news for next week hopefully.
Merry Christmas everyone!
No
2 grand does
So the Santa Clause rally was a fucking lie...
I bought calls when it was at 212 and got IV crushed the past 2 hours. I’m hoping for a 10% rippper tomorrow.
I wait until 12:50 to sell my calls, and then the market fucking pumps immediately after. Are you fucking serious? Fucking market maker cunts fuck you and your fucking bullshit
Hawaiian / 10
Merry Fucking Christmas Mofos! Market closed :( at least for me
Bot more Chers
Congrats on your $23.84 gain
Good game out there today boys. We almost had em. PLTR gang still hanging in there.
For Xmas movies, I recommend Die Hard, Lethal Weapon, and Trading Places
Got in on NIO for the (potential) run up. And an ARKG leap.   Still 💎 🙌 GME 2022 calls.
Look at the chart it'll plateau for a week and then dump
Fav stock long term?
Made a shit ton off TSLA today. Sold and now I’m balls deep on NIO and BABA leap calls.  China Gang Rise Up!!!! 🚀
yes sir yes sir three bags full
Welp lads and gals have a good 4 days
I keep waiting for abcl to find support but it just keeps bleeding. Fuck
lmaoo david tepper took a yuge position in MU when it was in the 40s a few months ago. I knew it was time to go long again, but wanted to be a fgt and play weeklies on mega tech
Wow living in the west coast must suck
Good grief
ARKG for my 2020 ira?
retarded pump to end the day fuck
Went from up ~60% for the week to up 11% cause I can’t help but fuck myself with puts 🤡
Christmas may have been bad but I got a good feeling about New Years 💵💵💵💵💵🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Loaded to the plums with BABA 1/15 130p.  Xmas / New Years yolo premium flip.  I think the market is going to shit on this one a bit more.
No chrimbus special miracle for me, thanks a lot tim and eric
Down $777 today, good omen?
I love how absolutely brain dead this sub is sometimes. The only thing getting squeezed are your balls when you lose your entire portfolio in fucking GameStop
Not the worst ending possible...at least heading into Christmas with some tendies now
That two finger game play
Aslong as it wasn't weeklies
yea same here but i think pepole are overeacting a little  shet hit nearly $212 lmao thats like even below last decembers market price  i lost the opportunity to jump in a gud price 2day but i think we can expect more bad news in the short future which might drive the price at around $230 or below  i have a feelin pooh and the gang are just gonna break jacks kneecap to show him and the other china companies wat happens when they try to fk with the gang
You too bro
Dear Diary, I lost tons again today.

I don't need to believe because he exsists
Finished today down 4%. Not that bad right
Lmao
Ideally I’d like it to jump to the mythical 40 before EoY so I can sell for Mr. Taxman
Shit I bought the 40 strike
Yup
i was scrambling to make a move before 1 but couldn’t get it done  reeeeeeeee  alright what’s a $1k play for monday

Today was a good day. BLNK rallied when it needed to most
GUH
I had 2 covered calls that have been ITM for a few days. They expire today. The market just closed, but it still shows me with the calls, and I still have the shares. Did I just get super lucky, and they didn't get exercised? I've never been called before.
I think aapl falls to 115 within 3 months.
Anyone else load up on SPY puts before close?
get fukt chit is only going up from here
GOEV
Legal Casino Action with a Kobe-like clutch finish!
Lol they made sure $AAPL closes under 132 for their covered calls. We run on Monday 📈🚀
Lost 8k today. What a great way to start Christmas. At least I’m still up for the week :( not a loss till ya sell right. Fuckin Amazon and nio
I bought some. I don’t think it will hit that price by 31 but I’m hoping to scalp a profit.
You have been banned from twitch
A fine day for day trading tbh. Big and fast swings all over the place. There are more strategies than just buy call and hope it goes up
Thank you Santa for the rally, very cool
BABA bag holders will be rewarded Monday
u grow up in a closet?
Have faith?
Should be illegal to be able to sell stonks on Xmas Eve .only buy orders go through
NIO/XPEV, please don’t fuck this up further. I’m already 24% down on fucking XPEV... $ROPE
Hey future millionaire
MVIS  OI puts at 6 are almost double the calls for January. Trying to push the price down. Load the fuck up on the cheap. This company has great things going for it.
I paused day trading today when I saw where things were headed.   I’m in rough shape but hopefully next week gives me some gains.  Decided to 🙌💎 and hold. Hoping GME isn’t a bust.   https://imgur.com/a/HgPTD82
PLTR back on it's way to $25 before 🚀 to $28 and then back down to $25...  This is the Circle of Life
Yes retard. The market “HALTED”.
I call those "yoyos" my fav toy
Puts are immoral
Nope
Apple cucked me so hard today, goddamnit.
time to take off this clown cosplay and put on an ugly christmas sweater 😀
Happy Holidays guys. I made $38 today, going to treat myself to a decent bottle of wine tonight 🤷🏽‍♂️
Ass chowder
Cant wait will we can say good bye to 2020. Good lord, this was a shitty year all around
That isn’t true. Cut social security, cut welfare, cut Medicare, Medicaid, cut the EPA, the FDA, military spending on defense only, and were a lot closer to 500b then you think.
Merry christmas everybody.
It’s been a good year for me: https://i.redd.it/g9gf3qnoc6761.jpg  XLK, TAN, ICLN were my biggest gainers, took $25k off and transferred to my savings
Merry Christmas all, see you Monday.
i meant this exact moment after early close lol
Down 3k 😀
keep 0DTE ITM if you must at least.  Tbh 0DTE is fucking pointless, you should have enough BP kicking around to at least day trade the next Friday's expiries
Merry Christmas you retards!  I gotta go return some presents.
2k stimmy talks **not** going well :(
Yeah I am jacked to the tits right now, same strike and expiry  40x $95c 1/15 as well  If I die, I die.
amzn plz
Spx closed at 3703, that’s actually a surprise
Of course
Thanks Santa for the 480% gain on SPX yolo 🥰
Market is closed tomorrow.

Jesus died for our stonks
Wasn't there a whole pinned DD about how it was going to moon to $500 today?
You will get exercised by Sunday, it's not instant haha
You’re gonna fry on Monday .. lmfao and you fool SPAC merger run ups are the easiest money in the game right now
He’s talking about people from Twitter today
Predictions for 12/31?
542 shares in GME. Whose got me beat?
congrats and fuck you
i'd be more comfortable with 240 as a lotto, but I don't see it dropping more on no news either so 🗿
Took an -8.87% ass pounding today 😩
The one who said the christmas run will be a green one and full of tendies.. show yourself
Little
Why do you guys buy end of day? What's the advantage?
wait. there is still extended hours on christmas eve?
Stop shilling that garbage
Yea I got cocky after a solid week. Not worth it.
PLTR is my most bullish position. But we ain’t seeing anything over 30 until at least January 1st.
X
But im not done trading :(
Merry Christmas or Happy Holidays? Which one is politically correct?
🤡&gt;🎅
Lol I ended up +22.44
We both can agree there.  The government is terrible at managing budgets.  And yes the small guys get the shaft vs corporations.  Which is completely shi tty.  Ideally they would increase funds and incentives to small businesses over corporations but lobbying ensures they always get the fatter part of the pork spending.
Retards are attacking Cramer? Smh kids today
Ah damn
Ladies and gentleman, the casino is closed for today. Please cash in your chips in orderly fashion.  If you have lost money and you owe money to the house, you will be escorted by casino’s security staff to the room in the back. Merry Christmas
0 share. I win
#Don’t forget to eat your green bean casserole
Gains a gain :)
Wtf market closed already
When it’s down like this it’s a discount dawg
Holy shit I thought the market closed @ 2pm and now I am for sure FUCKED.
Lol
Im down 30k lolololol
damn your timing is on point
Awwww shit.  Spy is really about to hit 380 on Monday on stimmy hopes isn't it...
Merry Christmas you filthy fuckin animals
They already do that. Raise taxes and close the loop holes. Where are they going to go? Europe, where the EU is going after them?   They want the protections of being US companies and operating in our legal system, they should pay their fair share.
Next year will be far worse
Anyone here in Mvis calls?
Yeah
[deleted]
Watch metals fly now that you cant buy any calls
If we count my calls I got you beat lol
They’ll exercise if they are itm by a penny. It’s not instantaneous
HELL NO
Both, fuck anyone that says different and I'm not even Christian.
People with even less brain cells
Cost basis $4.19 on mine. Bought weeks ago when it was back at 92 still. Wbu?
I mean I’m up 25% for the week 🤗
Both
It all gets better from here bro trust me I diamond handed because I know this game. January is going to be an insane bullrun for these stocks.
to make money off the gap up or down the next day
Same reason they buy and sell at open. To gamble, obviously
Lol I know man. Sorry :\
Fuck me for buying these shit calls on shit stocks.   https://imgur.com/a/FWlBnJN
Merry Christmas ya fuckin degenerates 🎄
I like the shorter trading day. You get both volatile hours and a much shorter period of nothingness
if white/mexican, merry xmas. if else, happy holidays
LET ME INNNN!!!
[removed]
Alright raise your hand if you yolo’d on BABA
lol did you buy FDs?
Yeah I don’t mind holding this long term but the share lockout ending in February has me wanting to take profits. But I got in at 14, so might not be worth it
Portfolio is full of spy puts! The end times come next week
Is Cramer on tonight?
Less for Uncle Scam, winning
Who bought puts at BABA LOD?  Me.  Fml
Okay you dummies, I've had a hell of a month with SPACs and I just spent some profits on 200 shares of GME and 200 shares of PLTR.  You've been posting about this bullshit nonstop for a month, at least make me some fucking Money while I'm scrolling past the wall of posts 🙏
Irs okay homie you made profit, now if you wanna get back in sell cash secured puts at your cost basis. Thetagang calls this the wheel.
Everyone shows themselves
What’s a 10 dollar percentage
The only reason I am up today is because of SIRJACKALOT. Free him 😡😡🚀
I think he was born
man nothings moving now, what a boring day
Today I went long on Ford and Honda, short on Intel. How do you guys think my plays will turn out? Missed the morning opportunity for gold calls sadly.
Greedy fkin mms pinning pltr below 28
How!? Baba??
Merry Christmas
Bro u got a year, your good
happy Hanukkah
Until 3pm est.
1100 shares at $6.80 yesterday.
After hours
good lesson lol albeit a bit expensive!  I keep 0DTE's ITM and almost always don't enter til an hour til close for power hour shit
Ah shit was hoping a Christmas special DD would go for some banter but alas, see you all next week

British people go on holiday. So Merry Christmas
I want my money back
Lol who’s your broker? On thinkorswim they will be assigned this evening.
GME at literally 2020, very legal, very cool.  Thanks for this year my, dudes. Won some, lost all of it and now clawing my way back.  Stay cool ✌
Now holding significant positions in GME, ATVI, GOOGL,BABA
no
Merry Christmas guys
Been freed apparently
BABA gonna end this thread of it slides to sub 200!!!!!!!
No
It’s one of the retards here moving to Twitter since Cramer “told” everyone to buy BaBa at $260. Always inverse Cramer.
And that will never change. Which is why we should give them less money. This is where we disagree, you believe the government can be fixed, I believe it is more or less impossible for one person to spend another persons money efficiently, which is essentially what the government does. Nobody spends my money better then me, nobody spends your money better then you.
Heads up boys.   Santa has something big in the works for us...
Buy high sell low
Yeah... I thought it was gonna move up more, but learned my lesson. Never traded a Christmas week before. At least lots of my index funds will help make up for a loss within the year if I have to take one.
It's about to be a long boring weekend
For holding the line and going down 13%, we'll be reward with up 2% on Monday :D
SQ burying itself into the ground while all the major indices fly. Of course I bought calls at the top
i think he got unbanned
Ugh 3 days of family and holidays with no markets. *barfs*
[removed]
Not bad, double the losses in half the time
Well, fuck this day.  See you autists Monday AM.  Happy December Holidays
No stimmy. Y market no crash
Today was a good day to buy into pltr. I would have bought more if I wasn't already 150k deep
So excited to see what happens during Christmas and on Monday! Merry Christmas y'all!
The best way to spread Christmas cheer is GUHing loud for all to hear 😫
Is next Thursday also a short trading day?
#  Why GME could squeeze as early as never
It’s considered polite to include your holiday well-wishes in your email signature now.   *Happy Holidays / Chag Sameach / Shanna Tova*
Merry Christmas you filthy animals!
every day the market is open is my channukah, christmas, and kwanza rolled into a nice fat blunt 🐴
   Wow, look at that vol./OI on TSLA 810c 1/21/22 leaps 👀
DQ, JKS, LI and XPEV might also pay off..
Merry Christmas you beautiful fucking retards, not much win today but fuck it, it’s the time to give. See you all on Monday. xoxo hahaha.

Ever have those days where you log in look at the market and do the rational adult thing and walk away? Yeah, me neither.  Baba 2/19 210c. Tsla 1/15 650c.
I think the MSFT $200 curse is over
When will Cramer be able to pump GOEV then?
[removed]
Meee
Idealistically yeah.  I remember when Clinton started cutting down on military bases.  People had a shit fit.  Only one in recent memory to have a budget that was projected to be balanced.  If we got closer back to that then yeah it may be more practical.  But how you do start cutting Medicare and the rest?
Santa Rally starts Monday sir
yeah I don't think there's any cause for concern here my man; drink a spiked eggnog and relax

BABA gang
Bruh...
4/20
That pltr gonna make you a millionaire. U straight fuked on the nio though.
lmao and who would be selling the stonk you buy?
You bought puts when BABA was negative on the 1Y chart?....RIP.
when they arent solvent
MGNI gang   😎
AAPL 141 12/31
What app is that? PLTR put was nice.
Imagine if markets were just open for 10 mins a day. The volatility would be insane. You'll have a chance to get rich or go broke every trading day.
TSLA mooning next week. Stimmy talks failing brings $ back to GROWTH STONKS
where is the promised gme short squeeze?
 If I lose you win. But yours are 100% more likely. I own like 350 stocks tho, so any gain is great for me.
How we feeling about our QQQJ calls?
Lol, forgot I was in central time again and missed the close. Merry Christmas you dumbasses
Usually there’s a big move end of day. If it moves against the direction you want to trade, you can get in at a good price.
Just hold man those are not bad plays
And here I thought BABA was my safest holdings 🤡
Covid 20 and probably another v2 virus pandemic is bullish for stocks.
Well.... I’m finally positive YTD. And I’m only down 60% all time. Honestly, it feels pretty good to be digging my way out.
gaaay
Theta gang, we had a good week
I thought they were doing a second bill just for stimulus checks?
Half day for Christmas eve.
Bought baba at 220
I’m going to stick to that rule next time I’m up to it. Conversely I did manage to buy SE 1/15 calls on big discount (which was one of my trades) so maybe I’ll make some of it back
Reeeeeeeeecap of today's market driving news:  * After POTUS' surprise backlash against the stimulus bill, rightly making fun of the bigly lame $600 check - House Dems moved quickly to try and pass the $2,000 amount they've been trying to secure now that POTUS has made a very public statement on it. McTurtle, now put into a no-win situation has been trying to weasel out of it by political manuevering. GOP and House GOP is now pointing to foreign spending cut as a means to push back and "secure" the $2,000 amount to Americans. House Dems are moving to another vote on Monday now that today's vote was blocked by House GOP. Meanwhile, as the bill stays stalled on POTUS's desk, the likelihood of a govt shutdown and lapse in UI payments for the 12 million unemployed Americans increases. Good times all around! * China, after making various antitrust statement in the past months has finally made good on their threat as they launch an antitrust probe on BABA. Shares of BABA drilled 9% in HK market and was down as much as 17% in US market during intraday low to $211. It'll be interesting to see if this will have actual material impact for BABA once the dust settles, but given how they blocked Ant's IPO, something is likely to come out of this instead of some unknown internal political posturing. BABA closed down -13.34% to $222. Shares of rival PDD is up big on the news, closing the day out up almost 9% to $152.75, while JD is down slightly -1.10% to $84.49. * In WSB meme stock land, GME closed with red day, pulling back slightly to end the day at -2.04% to close at $20.15. RIP to all those that went all-in on $21c and $22c FDs this week and didn't take gains. MT continues to trade fairly flat as its a long-play, once again, don't buy weeklies you dumb fuck. PLTR also close out red for the day, down -3.28% back to the cursed $27 range to close at $27.75. TSLA was able to close out its first week of S&amp;P trading on a green day, though its down overall for the week. TSLA closed up 2.44% at $661.77 after reversing from a fairly red opening yesterday morning. * The market edged out a green day yet again, with Dow up 0.2%, S&amp;P up 0.4%, and Nasdaq up 0.3%. It's Christmas Eve and the market has closed early, so if you're still hoping to get out of your 0dte FDs then you've done fucked up. Market closes tomorrow on Christmas day and no doubt the 3 day weekend will force WSB to yet again have an existential crisis as they wonder what they've been doing all year long and why haven't they become a TSLA/GME/insert-ticker-that-hasn't-sucked millionaire yet.  (Yesterday's recap: none, because I was lazy)
SSPK boys don't miss out. It's weed and technology.
I have a lot of room, GME buys at $3 made my account near half mill. ATVI buys were at $75. GOOGL at $1600 and today with BABA
Lol. Who here expired worthless today?
China fucked me good today but the NIO leaps I picked up on sale will be my revenge
Theres plents with 5 digit shares
Can’t wait to see my December statement. It’s gonna be a hot mess.

It's 5am in Australia.
Ya, and we’ll hear shorts have to cover.
thanks
Well I lost all my money but at least I learned a lesson about ahh Christmas or something
This is not the way of the Holiday Spirit.
Went deep on $HIMX today. 100 03/15/2020 $7 calls a s 5,000 total shares. I feel it in my soul.
G.HIV mooning AH
down 4% today 9% this week RIP
lol they pinned aapl right below 132. Cucked the 12/24 call holders
How big is your account?
When is Cathie buying RIOT
-20k reporting in
But are they, really?
Down 5.5k in two days but still up 30k on the month. Ain’t even mad. Loaded up for next week/month.
Yup, all sorts of good things coming for semiconductors next year. I’m in MU and ENPH now, really hoping for a good breakout.
If u can’t wait for the 4 day clear to buy options on tdameritrade, buy a stock sell it next day and you’ll be able to buy options with that money.
MARKETS CLOSED BITCH
Sarah Eisen has to work today?   Who did she piss off at CNBC
Theta gang says hi
Profit takers suck
Happy Holidays!
Interesting. Also running some theta gang shit.                           -2 1/15 30c -2 1/22 31.5c +2 1/08 30c                               Semi working. Basically just making money back from my calls with theta. I guess I like running @ break even.
I still need to look more into that. Seen a couple posts about it
Thanks, both my parents died on Christmas when I was 12
You can't trade options after hours lol
You bought in GME at $3??  You are either an absolute visionary or whatever the opposite of that is lol
Quick and short one cuz its a light news day. MM has already took off from their helipad and are busy enjoying the lines off that sexy guy/gal escort's chisel abs/plunky ass.  Might repost this when automod ever gets around to doing the weekend post.
*was* 160k
Spy weeklies
there is no 810c 1/21/22?
I hope everyone pre ordered today for mondays rally
I need to use it. I have a grand in there 😂
Finally I’m done losing money for the day. Merry Christmas fuckers
Got destroyed today, and now I got a 12hr day of work which is about to be busy as fuck. Pray for me

🤨
a long boring weekend and i’m poor
How soon does Robinhood make your tax documents available?
+73% on the week  MGNI gang 🚀🚀🚀🚀
now's a good time to buy tesla shares and sell calls on them. (Or sell put spreads / IC)  tesla is going to be way more stable going forward but there's still relatively high IV as a remnant from before, so cash in on that before the Iv drops.
Portfolio margin :)   I'm sure you can sell puts without being cash covered on tasty with a regular margin account.. look into upgrading your margin account, maybe you missed something
PLTR and NIO shall indeed...fly again 🚀🚀🚀🚀
Santa
Been sitting on a $29C for a month, this checks out
You were supposed to buy the dip end of day to enjoy a full week of deliscious tendies starting Monday 😋
😀
Merry fucking Christmas retards, take care
Either way my friend!  Best of wishes works too, and that is my wish from me to you.  Enjoy the break and get those dusty bowls washed and filled with something for Santa.
People would need to be convinced that keeping that extra 10% of their check would benefit themselves and the country more then the government taking it. I don’t really think it’s possible, people are really stupid. Milton Friedman died trying lmao.
McTurtle
4 day clear? The fuck you talking about.
It's odd that you think race has anything to do with religion.
When do you guys tend to enter your day trades?
making good plays nice
Palantir is such a dope name for a company
This would be more fun if on up days, someone handed me my profits in cash.
My man, hopefully it catches some volume on Monday
Mvis calls had a part to do with it
does this include baba?
Lmao
**HOW MANIPULATED IS THIS MARKET.. last 20 minutes spy goes from 367 to 369!?? Also I’m a bull but That isn’t good news. Long way down when we could have started the climb back to 369 on Monday 🙄
Because we’re going to get the $600 stimulus and Trump was just trying to look like a good guy and distract from horrifically corrupt pardons without actually doing anything.
beware of ENPH, price is WAY too high imo. unsustainable
SPACs usually decide their trend in the first week. I bought some shares just in case. Lemonade and Porch Group seem to do entirely different things, but if the housing market lasts, I don't see why this can't double.
Need GME to drop like a rock next week!
what is the best way to view sell walls / order books in thinkorswim
Merry Christmas you bunch of Door Knob Lickers. Remember to spread the gift of ~~gambling~~ options trading to your impressionable younger relatives. Also, stop eyeballing your hot cousin.
3 2/19 300cs
I want to bang Sara Eisen
Needs a catalyst. WSB projections were Q1 - Q2 in 2021.   I'll keep holding shares as this shit rises even without squeeze and I kinda want to see GME succeed.  Merry Christmas my dude.
You’re right.. I did
The global casino is closed for Christmas! Try to enjoy the holiday, doing nothing meaningful for the next 3 days and 1/2! 🤡
Made $8000 today on $26k
shit volume/OI what u mean?  OI should be higher then volume when eyeing positions like that
i closed at the top thank god

Lmao Sarah Eisen had to move to a new room - you can tell by the lighting
So many retards are losing money because they didn’t know the market close early today 😂
Today was a day that institutional investors took the day off and the insane asylum was run by the inmates who in turn sold and took profits because they have paper hands.
PSTH calls r so juicy. gonna be even better when i hold onto one and exercise it 🥺😎🥺😎🥺
Do we not make a new thread when the markets close on a half day? Is this because user zeejayzee quit yesterday? They won’t let me say his name
Jaydon 4 mod
-0.0073 lol
Didn't know today was a half day. Closed a risky position like 30 seconds before closing by coincidence (although a second one is open and will fuck me on Monday)  Marry Xmas you god damn degenerates.
I see. Well I hope we both win. Cheers mate
Positions?
Oh boy
At the high point. I’ve become quite skilled at it.
Unless they changed it it was 4 days before lol
Followed for more updates.  Good shit
At the worst times
How
It needed a pull back.  It's been ripping.  Plus there was something today about SQ buying Tidal.
Damn
Imagine not buying those ARK dips today 🤣
Ugh they blocking the stimulus again, back to 3-4 months of talks
Since ‘plant-handling’ companies can’t be publicly traded in the US, I think WeedMaps is going to be a really popular pick 👍
What's west of the west coast but still in the same timezone?

Get to the back of the line...
I hate x mas. Eff the new year.    OPEN THE DAMN MARKETS
Nice. I got feb expiration so I’m just along for the ride now

Cheers!

I’m now beyond balls deep in GOEV, I’m nipple deep and soon to be gargling for air.
Fuck I forgot to get my amzn calls in  Pleas don’t fly yet jeffie
If you didn’t buy the ARKG dip today you must hate tendies
In the night you will be visited by the three ghosts of Tendies
If Baba could just open at 235 on Monday that would be hella cool.
🤴
LMAO
Totally.
Have 4 days for CCP and BABA to start making out in front of the camera.
I kinda liked the fireworks screen saver.
Options are fuckin nuts, I watched some baba 215 puts go from $40 to over $500 to worthless by end of day
I bought some 290c, 300c, 305c for BABA at close, I might be the king of retards 😃🔫
#FUCK BABA, FUCK XI POOH BEAR FAT FUCK, FUCK CHINA AND CCP
You bulls are gonna get what you deserve 🐻
Thanks Chimpu
no, the bot just does it at the same time every day
had to move from ARK to BABA
Probably missed something, thanks for replying tho and congrats!
Remind me why I recognize that name?
I exaggerate a little but after Burry letter last year I put my full ira of near 20k in GME near $3.70. Then in March-April market collapse I put in 30k new money near under $4, but in April it dropped below $3 and I bought several thousand shares between $2.80-$3.30 on margin
No rocket for you
Yeah the canoe was sinking
Don’t forget   How can you have any pudding if you don't eat yer meat?
Ditto, but that’s more of a lotto i got in on Monday since there were rumors of a price target increase which just got published today. So hopefully that’ll provide a short term boost. I’ll take a two-bagger on it if there’s a chance.
Yesterday was -0.92 at close. Today it did closed higher which resulted in a net gain from the mega pump at the end. I got in after the huge APPL rally day, so the movement after that really fked me. Foolish for me to think it will continue to rally like a meme lol
You’re fucking insane. BABA is down 30% from its highs. Stocks like BABA don’t drop too much more than that
How do you retards obtain this much money? It has to be some kind of inheritance
We know we know we know if it doesn’t your hedge fund is moving it’s offices to under a freeway overpass
Well.... I trusted you before and look at me now 🙃 but no way but up anymore though.  No point in selling either.
Thanks 😊
Everyone complaining about the dips too...
What more money?
It’s Lord of Flies right now
Well that’ll be fun losing all that money
fuck you pltr that is all
I like you but you might be the biggest chaser on here  You always have a $50k play going on the prior month's meme stocks
Sold a new batch of FD covered calls and got a few more shares of pltr
Best of wishes to all of you for the Christmas break.  Do something nice for a stranger and keep the Christmas miracle alive.  Easy to say, hard to accept but I assure all of you: Health is wealth!
Dude same thing with my calls, I went from 45% up to 10% up. Is it IV crush?
We tank Monday
Ha thanks. Have a good holiday friend!
Yeah it was my first time playing AAPL. I wound up taking the earnings and swinging BABA. You’re gonna make a killing when earnings are in

Usually pile their gold horde at tax havens like Ireland or south east asia then issue bonds to pay expenses back at home. America literally has to bend down and suck corporate dick with tax holidays for companies to bring back home cash.
Yeah the problem here is social security and Medicare is a pyramid scheme at this point.  It isn’t the people paying that would need convinced, it’s the people receiving which generally makes up the majority of the voting populous.  They do not have the funds to float long enough to stop supporting those dependent on it now.

Flare checks out
Deep ITM ARKG calls were on fucking discount.
You don’t need those. You lost everything
Story isn't baba. Pdd printed fucking bigly off da news
Happy Holidays!
*maybe*, but what do we know about the market?  It's a petulant teenager.. overreacts to everything, and generally takes a little while to realize shit ain't as bad as it thought.
I bought all the dips this week basically, my cost basis is $3 right now because I forgot to sell some when it ripped up past $92 today  I am going to need to start selling some at the rip and re-buying at a lower cost if I can  AMD usually goes up, them comes right back down again. Has been doing this for months...
Its down 33% in 2 monts. More than half of these losses  were in 1 day (today). I would call it darkest. I think,  it's oversold,  and should bounce,  at least in short term
for $600, I bought 155 x IWM 120p expiring 1/22/21. I think mango fucks shit up bigly the next 4 weeks. Y'all need some kind of hedges if you have any long positions.
  Happy Holidays!
Market is running on hope.  In this case the hope something will get cobbled together.  If you believe your thesis just short the market, or buy 3X short SP500 ticker.
Ok big dawg, I see you.
Happy Holidays!
#FUCK CHINA AND FUCK PANDA EXPRESS 🐼
Happy Holidays!
You must be fun at parties
Huge pltr position?
PT for BABA 180 next week
Happy Holidays!
Probably not though
Man can’t knock that resolve. Props to staying with a play you believe in. Definitely has paid off
Happy Holidays!
It's automated, and I doubt they special case half-market days. Don't be surprised to see a daily thread for tomorrow.
M-Melvin is that you?

Your mom? (Because somebody else was gonna do it. )
Maury, Bears died today and you’re laughing
pray for the autists that dont have jobs and still yolo away all their money bruh
What happened he seemed like a solid mod
Just watched Charlie Rose interview Jack Ma. China govt definitely doesn’t like the way he thinks. He has a realistic view on the modern world that would be great in the US. Wish we had someone influential like that here and help us rebuild small business.

If you can take thousands or even tens of thousands in losses and still live the same life, enjoy it. Good things don’t last forever.
...and then what happened?!
Xi made it his plan to destroy WSB once and for all!!! Coal for Christmas!!
Buy SPACs at NAV and wait, make somewhere between 25% and 1000% profit, sell and repeat.  Makes buying regular stocks seem as risky as options.
Wait markets aren't open Monday are they ?
Hey only like 1/4
What a wack day. VIX went down with major indices basically flat.  That stim vote failing robbed us of multiple 10 baggers but I'm a patient man.  Bought some March and June calls with low volatility.  Tech earning season is coming back.
wish there was panda express in nyc lol
I want to believe you but everyone who has said the market will tank on a Monday was wrong. ATH incoming.
Merry god damn Christmas
Sweet! Positions?

dude buying puts after a $40 dip is just 🐷 plays
Alright mates. Got 3000 shares of PLTR on the dip and gonna hold till this shit moons. Let’s fucking go.
You need a radio station dedicated to WSB market news.
I wouldn’t touch that piece of shit canoo with a 10 ft long crusty dick
Good to know, thanks for the info 🙏
Any thoughts on AMZN calls @3250 expiring on 1/29? Earnings is 1/28 and they should be reporting a monster quarter... chart looks like it's ready to run.

Pretty much the bear hypothesis: "It is about to tank!" No TA required.
AMD has my calls bleeding with this sideways action
Super 🌈🐻
How big a Sunday gap up are we talking about?
down leg of a PLTR straddle
why would they not be open monday
Happy Holidays. I hope your bowls are dusty!
PLTR so funny cuz you come on here at premarket and everyone is like “omg pltr buying me a new boat lets fucking goooo!!”  then you come on at close and you’re all like “i cant pay rent because of pltr”
Up 60 bucks today. Merry Christmas to me.
Bruh
Gonna sit out until just before biden inauguration because I feel like the next few weeks are gonna be a trainwreck😐
Wonder how many people didn't know it was a falf day and are now recieveing Secret Santa gifts in the form of assignments 🎅✋👜

Wait til shutdown hits and every federal employee has to play the drain your savings, eviction, food bank lotteries...
Sir, Panda Express is an American company....
We dine in Tendie Town next week my fellow Canoodle
Fuck this day
Anyone else see that jump on GME AH 👀 ? Isn’t showing up on RH
Once upon a time when these positions were a little more mainstream they discussed how they would get rid of social security, basically we could cut a check to every person under the eligible age, for their money they paid into it back. The current old people would be grandfathered in. Moving forward, no more payments. It’s not perfect but we’re going to have to take an L at some point, or our social security will expire worthless like the 4/20 180 SPY Puts this sub was holding.
Same but shares. Haha.
Not sure the premium on it (breakeven) but it sounds like a solid play
The Ghost of Net Worth Past, the Ghost of Christmas Yolo Present, and the Ghost of Bankruptcy Future
For those of you that bought BABA calls today. How far out were you buying?
I was told there would be a Christmas rally. Where is it??  That said, Merry Christmas you degenerates. May tendies flow in the coming new year. 🎄🚀🎄
One hour at a time
I rememeber the day enph got the hindenburg hit squad report an fell to $30 / share by the end of the day.   Almost yolo'd my entire 401k / IRA / brokerage account into the stonk...but did not for no good reason.   this run up lately has just been insane. good luck on the position.
He's the guy who likes eating whore feet and pussy.
Have good christmas yall. Take a break from the market
Whos the pussy giving awards for Marry Christmas or happy holidays comments. It was a godamnnn bloodbath
Welcome to the trap 🙏 🚀 🌚
There’s lots of money in volatility.
I don't know about anyone else but mine has been saved through years of hard work. I've been an engineer at NYU Langone for almost 10 years making 6 figures. This is the dumbest and most risky I've been with my money in a long time.
i think china is cool
If you invested in BABA 1 year ago you’d be up 3%  Congrats
🙏🏻
Stocks rally on renewed hopes of deal that was just shot down
Let’s create a WSB Army so we can annihilate Lord Gay Boy XI once and for all. $BABA $400c
Ahhhh....yes. Yes.
Hey y’all I fucked myself over cause I’m a retard, lost all my gains cause I am new to calls and made a oopsie, what do I get in on on Monday to make some of these ouchies go away
Oof. Good luck
After seeing sir jack a lot dumped I am losing my appetite
I’m in SPACs but to have 150k to yolo on PLTR shares at (I assume) a young age, it seems like that’s not possible without having at least a giant startup pool
Lost 10k on BABA calls. Merry Christmas to you too Xi
Picked up some mid Jan PLTR 30 calls at the end of the day.
Must be hack
I’m fucking done. I was waiting for SPY to hit 369 to sell me calls expiring today and it barely touched. Fucking market manipulation
there are plenty in nyc
Gimme positions
Suck my calls bitch
Soon
Which are?
I got a pretty good price on my 2/19 300cs even with the iv. Less than $60. It goes up to where it was before I’ll print.
FCEL
What if i bought it right before the crash?  Am I still good?
Boomer investing 101. Go long.....way long
I wouldnt know ive never even thought of buying itm due to the reasonable leverage
what a fuckin lame ass market day
Tesla calls in and out all day
People are confused by a 50B company trading like a penny stock.

So is heroin
Still profit
what’d you lose? $5?
Think mango fucking things up is priced in.  I think his pardon party of close friends, war criminals, and tax cheats is another passive sign that he knows he lost and is going full Casa Bonita, Eric Cartman style.  He probably ways to start a war with Iran since that’s what he says an outgoing President could do to stay in power, but even that will be reined in.
Only down 1.1% today. Not a horrible day

PENISES DOWN
MMS are in the Maldives, today was a bunch of pussies taking their Christmas bonus. The melt up resumes on Monday.
Slight red day today, but huge week overall.   Merry Christmas boys. Have a great weekend. See you Sunday night for Futes.   And as always...keep holding GME.
this is actually the way
Learn to speak and cuss like an adult
So what. Fuck em
Got 5k for my Christmas bonus what should I yolo it on
2%? Nothing to fear
Just bought in on ARKG.. i know I’m late to the party.. so I picked up shares.
CNBC just showed that same 2019/2020 airline graph that was posted on here a few days ago lol
Oh ok, I wasn’t aware you’ve been in a career for 10 years just thought you were a kid like half the other ppl here. Should work out for you though I’m not sure PLTR is that risky honestly
I bought spy puts at 1159. Ama
Everybody relax.... Xi just wanted a cheaper buy in point. Business as usual on Monday 💎👐🥸

Beating wsb by 103 percent. Not too bad
Good things take time
So better than most of WSB?
Christmas rally is last 5 days of the year plus first 2 days of new year
man, I bet a lot of people bought BABA weekly puts on Wednesday just based on the charts potentially setting up a drop.
They should have sourced it WSB instead of TSA
Speak EST
Nope
It’s following snowflake I guess cause they have a huge position in it
It is only bullish under Trump presidency, it’s actually the worst case scenario under Biden.
...??
[removed]
NIO is gonna pump January whatchu talking bout
earlier her hair and makeup looked like she just got railed
Biden basically said no to cancelling 50k in student loan debt. Despite the fact that it would only cost 1T and literally be a stimulus for middle and low income. This is why I have no doubt the market will continue mooning under status quo Joe. He'll print and pump for the mega rich just like everyone else.
let's get the bread! I have 09/21 $250
Embrace it
Was definitely a stressful ride and admittedly I’m nervous about BABA. Good luck to you man!
Oh stfu. 99% of the people who are getting their panties in a knot have never even fucking heard of these people before trump pardoned them. Suddenly it’s a giant issue. Fuck off
Full speed ahead!   I can see a moon over yonder, it’s dipped beyond the horizon.
Nah like 350 lmao, not enough to truly be upset about but enough to say fuck!
CRSR gonna need to partner with GME to exclusively sell their gaming gear at the newly created cyber cafes / TSLA showrooms
minor setback for a major comeback
Puts it is then
Mainly people thinking, wow, green by EOD.. buy.. then price slows down, oh, never mind, I don't want to pay that much anymore. Also the call holders thinking, maybe I should secure my profits and sell.. supply &gt; demand, price drops.  Or I made that up and it's not how option pricing works at all. This is why I moved away from options for the most part.
Bought 20k worth of baba stock today. Merry Christmas guys buy the dip.
You have Red Poke, it's fucking delicious   One of the things I miss about nyc
DIS chart looks radical 🛹🤙
No
Don’t fight it, stay away

Indexes green, what do you mean?
What if it drops more next week?
You can still buy puts now.
What’s the stock trading equivalent to Charles Barkley putting 100k on the trailblazers to win the west?

Happy holidays, you filthy degenerates.

Note to self: stop playing dailies with large sums of capital
that’s just you’re brain coping you schizo
added more PLTR and went into XL. hmm
AI and SPCE
This is the way
I thought Santa would bring me some tendies early but instead he left me 1 share of Microsoft, a Nickleback CD, and a note saying "Suck my candy cane gaywad!" What the fuck!?
Nice. See u at the next shareholders meeting with Xi and Jack Ma
Actually the perfect time.
Whatre you in?
Hahaha Merry Christmas!
Jack Ma anyway looks like someone who fucks his ass with his own fingers without first washing them
What are you talking about no it didnt
year and a half out... 350cs.... literally cant go tits up right
shouldnt the new direct listing thing for new companies be a guh for SPACs without targets
I would not put it past China to say that the anti-trust probe came up with nothing, or slaps just a small fine on BABA. They just wanna fuck with Jack Ma and American investors.
Well I hope GME goes up
Icln leap
Crazy. Thanks for the info bud
I’m all in on MGNI leaps (and FLueNT, but I can’t talk about that hear).  But I’d be looking at UVXY if I was expecting volatility.
GME tomorrow and turn it into 20k
If boomer invests 3 million he is up 30 k on your ass
Any chance of stim Bill passing over Christmas weekend? Huge Monday pumps if so 🚀
Today was a good fucking today exclusively because of Tesla. Every other day this week was horrible exclusively because of Tesla.
Not early but I don't think it's late. Still set to double IMO by Q4 2021. Not exactly rockets but...
It won’t. This was a low volume red day ahead of long weekend. Moon monday
Sarah Eisen clearly has puts on Hawaii
Take it easy on calls and do your research bro. Always diversify and know how much you are ready to speculate. Have good one
ubi &gt; debt forgiveness
We need a $MEME ETF
BABA closed where it was at last year.  Just gives you another chance,  who missed the rally
Remember that big tech earnings are coming up late January into February.  Pick up low volatility calls or options when the tickers are red.  Don't recommend holding through earnings but you can bet that they'll have a spike before earnings.
You realize future traders will buy anything..... right?
Ended up pulling the trigger... premium was $109.  There goes my down deposit on the family pool (Christmas Vacation)

I am both an idiot and autist but I bought 240c 2/19
Strong bear flag, according to Zacks
You're right, I *am* insane, but that doesn't make my guess *wrong*.  What caused it to drop?  News.  What will cause it to go up?  News / sentiment *countering* what cause it to drop.  How likely is that?  50 / 50.  I'm leaning toward people seeing that massive fucking drop when they look at their portfolios, panicking because the market is closed, and selling more on Monday.  However, if "good" news comes out, maybe they buy the dip.  If it doesn't between now and Monday, I'm thinking we see more freak out.  Then we have to take into consideration Asia, Euro, people on holiday and not even looking at their portfolio, etc.       ...what happens if *more* bad news comes out?  It surely ain't gonna make the shit moon.    What are the odds of funds pushing news to push it down further so they can buy more, cheaper?  Pretty fucking high, since that's the kind of shit they do.  Of course, I could be wrong.
Why tf is he always so cock hard for the Blazers? Been a fan my whole life, they always suck except that 2001 year when they got hosed by the refs in Game 7 vs the Lakers

PLTR is going on a moon mission Monday
Turned 26k into 8k? Grats bruh.
Sounds perfectly how it’ll be
Icln leaps
I’ll take that!
No. 2 on Boomer Investing 101 = diversify. They will never buy $3 million worth of BABA so the joke is on you
If we had a completely fiscally responsible government this would be doable.  However it took them 6 months to come up with a bill that ended up funding some strange shit.  Even I’m scratching my head on some of it.
I love green bean casserole. And cranberry sauce that is can shaped.
me too. 1/15 330. What’s your Strike/expiry?
Xi ripped me a new asshole today
💯
I'd be okay with free college for in demand jobs.  And slowly reducing the amount of work visas for those in demand jobs.   I do not want my taxes going to lesbian dance art though.
bruh PJ traders fuckin love selling off. They're the quickest to smash sell on any spookiness  See: Monday
this is my strategy
Merry Christmas everyone of you degenerates
BABA leaps seems like such an obvious play that it’s bound to fail. That being said, in for 11/21 270c
Well account is at ATL, I am officially not having fun anymore. Luckily it's all long dated, gonna delete RH app and let it ride. MSOS, CRM, BABA, MT, DM
9 out of 10 doctors recommend that way
Taking off till the 4th  Bye bye work and hello to an undisturbed week of stonks
what the fucking fuck, corsair? 2 big down days in a row? No. not okay
Remindme! 10 days
I think it will; today was a low-volume day and every move is magnified.  Even if it drops further it'll bounce back eventually -- can't see it going too low in the near future.
off what
Fat chicks need luvin too
If silver would stop being a bitch and hold 26 thatd be dope
I really feel it’ll start it’s ascent towards 100 the closer we get to earnings on the 26th. That’s really the only catalyst I see saving my calls
Woof. Good luck Clark
Cheater
I’m prolly gunna regret not buying the baba dip
Selling drugs to kids
I think if their tech actually works good they'll  have some catalysts by then and/or new customers to make it go up.
Small asian peewris got ya good eh?
Cool cool thanks

Would u let Tim Apple pee on your chest for leaps
Bought the NVDA dip
Who the fuck is still selling after hour? Fuck off and go home already you pathetic POS!!
Puts on your wealth.
Getting momma a gift with these last minute gains ❤️
I’m not touching the piece of shit until after New Years. Already played it once and almost got burned.
Well today was fucking brutal.  I am diversified, and on a green SPY day, all my shit was red all the way across the board.
What’s your plays
Im stuck at work for 2 more hours, wtf am I suppose to stare at now
American Chinese food is better than authentic Chinese food.
Been riding it for massive gains on long calls, considering scaling into it more for even longer term positions.  Best ARK imo

Is GME donso? Time to offload positions?
She's cute but she's a gaybear.

Me for months: if BABA hits 250 I'm buying 200 shares.  Me today: I better wait for 200.
I assume you use RH. After hours goes until 8pm EST. Not sure if it closes earlier today or not.
Good for you. Now go home and get your fucking shinebox!
Yeah it's retarded, but fuck it.

CNBC headlines saying $2K stimmy check not likely and then goes on to say Crazy Nancy will hold a vote on it Monday?
Thought so. But I'd take 10k. Better than nothing
i remember back when i was an emotional bitch and i put 9000$ on spy 0DTE to try and scalp and constantly revenge trade.  im glad ive grown. i dont think ive touched a spy 0dte since that day, (3-4 months ago) and I usually dont have that much control. Much better trader because of it, dont day trade boys. By swing trading you increase your chances of profit vs day trading by like 40%
Wtf PLTR?
Xi doesn’t care about stocks. He’s anti capitalist hello?
Have you been naughty or nice?

I fucking love cheap American Chinese food cooked by Mexicans.  Nothing better.
Got a few 1/15 ACB $7p 's and acb fell today by 5% and the put value remained the same and even dropped some. Could anyone explain for my retarded ass, I figured the put value would increase
Hahaha, okay, this one is really funny!
So Ally was blocking me from selling shares today, I called support and they told me that Ally has “made a business decision to close the account” lmao what is this shit I’m so confused. I’d been slowly moving my positions over to RH and just had some of my stinkers left in Ally (mainly BABA) so is this there way of telling me to fuck off already? I’ve never had any bad transactions or negative balances  Guy on the phone told me I should be able to liquidate everything any time I want but the app was literally stopping me from selling BABA today   😡 Ally
You mean msg loaded teriyaki tastes better than wuhan bay soup?
Thats some oddly specific projection me thinks
It's free money. They'll bounce back. It's fucking baby Alibaba
Both of those things can be true
Did they not vote today? What tf is happening
&gt;CRM, BABA  same, help
Obviously. Real Chinese food is fucking disgusting food for pours.
Ok buddy.... That's why the chinese have so many businesses..... Trust me he cares about money just as much as the rest of us🤡🤡🤡
Same.   As well as more ARKG
Everything was red lol ya wife on her period. Still smashed her tho
Zero chance, unfortunately
Hell no. The 600 check one barely passed. Now they're grovelling over 2k.
wow the 40 year establishment career politician maintains the status quo  shocking
I gave her a gift too
If BABA tanks on Monday, I'll pretend hackers got into my account and went on a BABA spread buying spree
Why do you assume I use RH? I mean, I do but still. I also have a boomer account at Vanguard lol! I just needed to know if I'll be staring at my phone for AH action for 2 hours or more this afternoon haha.
Probably the richest too
I see youre still learning options. Maybe if it dips a bunch monday you can sell for a slight profit
Not apple leaps
Weekly QS play. QS made me about 30k so I’m not mad about it. Snaps dip took me for 1k but I got til Jan 31 with them. Averaged down. Bought in more in today dip on a few others
Sharks are just sexy fish
Jack Ma looks like he has a dirty dick
Monday Trading Plan:   Rather than buying another stock on Monday, I am gonna go out and look for a used Hot Tub Time Machine from 2010. Then I will travel back in time and make some YOLO trades.  GENIUS
I bought 1000 shares of l u m o back in April on a whim, should have gotten more fuck!

I dunno I hear the bat soup is pretty delish
Probably won't do much till earnings.

damn BABA got absolutely destroyed today, 13% in a day for a company with 600b market cap...
https://i.imgur.com/ByjpKMV.jpg Look at today’s volume on BABA on the year chart
One of my best trades of all time was dumping my huge amount of BABA calls last Friday at a 20% loss wew that was gratifying then and it is very gratifying today. Never touching anything chinese again (except NIO you can still get this D 😘)
Honestly I feel like you could pick any China stock this year and win big bucks once Biden in office.
Good. Keep the status quo
Yeah i dont see a Ma Bell splitup scenario. Baba is too intertwined in their economy and quite frankly their most successful domestic company ever. Heck how many citizens and Committee members own Baba?  Its like owning Apple. Everyone owns Apple. National pride that drove them to try to build their own airliner means they aint gonna shoot the Nio, Baba goose. Tighten the collar aye until jack ma toes the Party line.
&gt; James Harden  They attempted the ez way but House Rep blocked it. Will do more formally on Monday
I am a drunk trust fund baby so no problem yoloing
Only if you didn’t sell before and are not going to sell later, but today - just today

She came over to sweet talk me into letting her buy a new car, somehow she got a back massage, I got no sex, and she has a new car.  This is a true fucking story.  I'm now the proud owner of a minivan as of an hour ago.
Probably but even Cramer said he wants to wait another day to see how it goes.

You really think PE is Chinese food? Lollll
So are my feb calls fukd
Jack ma fucked the pangolin
Same for me with v u z i. I saw a training with someone using the glasses and bought in without any DD. Fukr went up 170% in 2 weeks.

I am hungover and horny as FUCK

Let’s have a little BABA bag holder cope thread in the daily. Roll call retards how much are you down today? Did you sell? How much more can you take before you give up? Give us the juicy details 💦
This
The loss not enough, not enough volume, theta, could be a bunch of things
bruh no one i mean no one goes around and fucks with the pooh gang  jacks probably gonna get slattered in honey and spitroasted
Because RH's AH is only 2 hours and premarket is only 30 mins while most other brokers is way longer for both.
TSLA saves my ass every time
Depends, is he dehydrated?
I think we get it, you are overexposed to pltr, you are scared and you have realized you have made a bad decision, it’s still a pump and dump. No amount of shilling will change that. You will lose a fuck load of money.
dude I'd let him pee on me for a share and will come back every day for more
I dont know. That dude’s head is not proportioned right. Big head, big forehead, small hair on top
Anyone who thought that was going to happen is hilariously uninformed.   Biden is the guy responsible for making it so that student loans are not part of bankruptcy protection...which was paid through his son who was sitting on a legal board at the time. There was controversy about the payment at the time...long history of going through Hunter to pay off daddy.    RIP toeveryone gambling with student loan payments 😆
That volume, though.  If you sell them at market order - you will rank it back to April's level, lmao
Imagine thinking China is more powerful than the USA 😂 they are some dumb fuckers. See $LK and $BABA
I gotten set rules for 2021. How on earth have I lost in 2020 is only my retardness and paper hands fault.   So:  1. No shorts, no puts  2. No options 3. Shares only  4. If leveraged x5 is Max  And hoooooold.   Fuck me. First thing on monday I'll do is probably YOLO in some stupid shit and paper hand once it drops a little.   I still got 13k from my 21k trading account in. Any ideas for a 2021 comeback? Gotta make at least 8k...
Yeah buddy! Same sauce. We can get matching yachts and name them, more theta 2 and 3
DKNG fucked me hard
Anybody else cum when they hit their gag reflex with their toothbrush 👐👐👐
Tomorrow?? Lmfaoooo
I put 11k into ARKG today and 1k into BABA
Yea it still is.
I bought some cheap call spreads expiring 31, hopefully Amazon rises Monday on boxing day numbers
Yeee haw. Got first planned purchase in at  12.8X. Looking forward for the $10's so I can net a 10 bagger lol. 1.5 Billion book value when all set and done.

Depends on the dish.   Both have some nasty ass shit.

Doubling down on hell effing NO
I have some glow in the dark band-aids holding my portfolio together at this point.  Best of luck, hope you learned a lesson at least.  Have a wonderful holiday season, forget about it for a while, and take care of what's important.

If you fill out trusted contacts in brokerage apps, there’s a dirty little clause in there saying they can do whatever they want if they deem that your unfit to make sound decisions with your account  I’ll never fill out the trusted contact section, only the beneficiaries and add a trust section
Hell yea brother
Whats the opposite of progress? CONgress 😂
Oh shit that's a fair point. No offense taken man. My RH is my options play account because it was easy to set up.

some idiot must of put in the wrong price for their order...it was only for 1 candle
This makes no sense. Not even a little. Either they’re in for a serious legal fight because any news outlet would devour this, or you’re only telling us half the story.
Imagine being this guy, lol
In a BLNK of an eye, BLNK is at 300 mid-2021. It's not just about providing charging for EVs. The real margins will be ad dollars on their stations.
All in ARKK or ARKF
Nah there’s going to be hype leading up to GA runoffs on the fifth if there’s even a hint of Dems sweeping.
Too bad you didn't record the phone call
Throw all of it at some SPAC while they’re still pumping them
BFT warrants and don’t be a paper handed bitch. They will print
romeo must die.
Oh yeah, mid June right? That’s always a fear factor for sure. Kind of upset I didn’t buy in 2018 when I first spotted it.
Wow vix is down 8% today
So first time option trader from UK deposited 800 bucks to tastyworks last week. Blown it all on weekly and 0 days. To be honest I opened calls on gme and puts on nkla both of which would have been ten baggers if not for the fact I panicked sold them as soon as they went against me. Fuck my paper hands.

What a combo
according to zero research and just based on a few tweets i've seen that may or may not be true, historically S&amp;P growth is greatest under a dem president and split congress, but also the difference is just a few percentage points no matter which way it's sliced and the only logical conclusion one can reach is stonks only go up
I probably got 10% of that companies shares 🤣🤣🤣🤣

Baba stock going up doesn’t make me think Wow China is so much more powerful! But you go ahead keep that going 😂
Im trying to help you but have fun losing money.
That’s how bureaucracy works. You put in 900B and end up giving $600 to consumers... when 600x300M is only 180b. So we could have sent out checks 5... 6 times as big? This happens with literally everything the government does. Including the other 5 trillion they gave out.
Crumpet hands
Should have had some TSLA calls
Maybe BABA. It was at 300 a couple months ago, down to 220 now due to regulatory problems. My guess is it will double in the next couple years from 220. Leaps are a decent play here.
Why are they having only Red and Green?   I love corsair because everything is supposed to be full RGB.
What are some good spacs to buy right now? Stic seems like a good one based on the post I saw yesterday
Took such a massive L on Tesla yesterday sold my 6 calls on the dip
Ain’t no one buying it for u fucker. This is a casino not a charity

so glad most of you made a million dollars this year, thank you so much for the constant daily reminders!!! absolutely nothing changed about my life this year, despite spending every waking minute here.
Idk but I need this because I basically bought the top. Average price of 14 per share. Sigh.
So BABA lost what? 100 billion today? Yikes.
Everyone holding baba trust me you are not fucked at all. Long term this stock is going full on Amazon status. This dip is a blessing and a curse. I don’t hold baba cuz I knew this was coming but she’ll bounce nice when it happens.
lol... people will still be saying this to me in 10 years, just because of my username.  I don't study with the same intensity anymore, I found that I can make $ just by (generally) following meme pumps, buying contracts 45-65 days out on solid stocks that have been consolidating for a while, and an occasional yolo.  It took a fucking long time, *countless* books / vids / lectures and a lot of money to figure that shit out.  Simplify and follow the trend.  2021 will be the year.
Portfolio up 105% this week. RMG bringing the Christmas tendies
Good. If they pomp stonk idc
There is already MOON which is pretty much that
🍾
Ally is pretty trash tbh, RH may not be the best but I picked it up cuz it was super easy to get into options and the charts/metrics are better. If you tell me TOS or WeBull are better I’ll believe you, but compared to Ally, RH is fucking awesome
In order to defeat China, the US and India should combine to become one country. Would be so badass
What would you do if you’re down 10 Percent  Would you sell or would hold all these bags   Lend me your ears and I’ll sing you a song   And I’ll try not to sell all these bags
Lmao
Yea, it’s pay to play.  Highest bidder gets to write the laws
I think you have to wait til after 9pm to post stuff like this.

I sold out of baba shares last month. bought leaps today.
Leaps? Like ARKG leaps or just straight up ARKG /ARKK shares...
Depends on which retards you ask
bro puts are risky
I wonder if they will release WW1984 early tonight rather than tomorrow morning at 3AM
GOP blocked 2K Christmas. GOP killed Santa
Did you sell?
Open a support case, first one is free
225 or 230 ok with me.

Nope. Thats the rest of the market when they all think of selling at the same time
If you don't hate both sides of government then you ain't black.

First of all, Why the fuck did you trade on Ally. 2nd, own their stock but have zero money in their accounts.

How about $600? It’s all we can do.
It was Senate Republicans that blocked you from getting a $2,000 check on CHRISTMAS EVE, in a PANDEMIC YEAR. Can't make this shit up.
Well this sucks. Merry f’ing Christmas
if you knew, should have bought puts
So you’re saying, nice entry point for BABA if we aren’t in.
As a board member,  you should suggest them to start making ev, or solar panels. Put it up for vote
Oh ya
Obviously
Presidents don't actually affect economy as much as they make it sound like they do
I totally understand your skepticism. But I’m clueless. It’s not like my account is in the red or anything. I’m not too worried though I’ll just make damn sure everything is transferred out on Monday, they still have like 25k of my assets

I picked up RH on a whim because I wanted to trade options and I know they approve anyone. Next year I might check out TOS or WeBull
I have 3 brokers, RH, Webull, and TOS.   RH for small options play where I don't want to pay $1 for each contract. Webull for super early premarket trades (it opens at 4am EST) and also has free options but I hate their UI, and TOS as my main account since it's the most advanced. If TOS had free options and earlier premarket hours, I'd shut down my RH and Webull account.
It was for whoever sold you those calls.
This was excellent. I really understand this concept now. Thank you.
LMAO
Always hold to expiration, don't doubt your vibe

Cramer on BABA - https://twitter.com/jimcramer/status/1342163192944930817

I already owned a couple $25s for that date so I was just able to cut down the downside.
It's -2%?
MGNI.. i have no idea what it does. I picked up 25 30c two weeks ago.. luls. How high is this going? Should i realize profits
Her are my rules... and they’re gone.  Probably do some good DD and play it moderately risky.
Is anyone in QELL? It’s another EV SPAC.  I tried doing a search here and I can’t find any talk of it. I’ve taken a break here for a bit just getting back. Got that Christmas bonus to blow!
BABA rebound so obvious lol
The PTON algos have been very generous lately.
Those PM hours on webull would make a difference. I've been contemplating switching.
QELL
Damn these bid/ask spreads are wider than your moms sloppy gash
Yeah why not. I'm thinking of going all in on ARKG leaps on the next 3-4 % pullback
Republicans have to lose Georgia now right? Who the fuck would vote for them? Literally keeping money out of Americans hands
Hope you used VPN
Should i buy into STIC now or when Barkbox lists under BARK on chasdaq? What’s the difference. I read STIC investors will have 12% of BARK shares. Not interested in that bs. Looking for swing trade for the ipo. Not sure if most price action will be in STIC or BARK. I am an autist. Yolo
&gt; Long term this stock is going full on Amazon status.  &gt; I don’t hold baba
Made my Xmas that’s for sure
Welcome to the team. Also, all indicators point to dump next week.
Yea feel it out for a few days
Good time for some VIX?
Can’t even wipe my ass with these tp hands
Stop buying BABA, I'm EU and cant buy till monday
360s 1231
Curious to know if ARK bought more BABA today to average down on the shares they bought on Monday.
Why deep in the money? I went deep OTM...
Maybe. I don’t mess with puts (yet). I wouldn’t bet against EV/Solar anytime soon with Biden on the way in. I’d rather play it safe with Leaps on ICLN/TAN. Other safe’ish bets would be CHWY/PTON/CRSP shares/leaps. But that’s my risk tolerance in my mid 30s. In my 20s, I didn’t hesitate to drop 6 figures on TSLA when shit was still on the brink of bankruptcy every earnings report.
It will
Was down -$50k today but managed to do some high IQ dip buying and closed at -$65k for the day. Merry Christmas
Depends if you think stimmy passes
Where do you think XL will be come February?
Wait, so did STIC close at $18.50?
Definitely this is insane discount ,I'd maybe wait till Monday tho see if there's another  drop but a rebound is for sure
Only thing we got for xmas is the shaft 👉🍑
Just make sure to learn when to take profit. Riding every contract to expiration is how you explode your account
nursing home REITs?
not obvious, china only opened an investigation, what if they take action?
RMG doing work
hopefully all my 1/15 calls print....
i think they can and do significantly affect the economy, but the upward inertia of the stock market is too strong and in the long run will be pulled or pushed up by any number of factors.  that's why i find it pretty dumb when people talk about presidents having "pro-market policy"
I will stop the world and melt with you
This is a huge dip, obviously it’s going to get filled seeing as how the company isn’t going to magically disappear. Stonks only go up
So the US gave trillions in bailout money to large corporations who didn't need it https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/business/coronavirus-bailout-spending/, but can't afford remove student loan debt which is only 1.6 trillion? literally not even sweat for the fed, fuck the corrupt ass leaders of this country
I say there’s a 42% chance that we’re getting 2k come Monday and maybe a 74% chance they “compromise” and make it 1200 again
The problem with sending Mitch McConnell to the guillotine would be that no one can tell where his face ends and his neck begins.
Find out what the company actually does before calling it a pump and dump
If I can’t have it, I’ll burn it to the fuking ground.   -Cheeto
Also retarded. Even more so bc I was averaging down

Jesus. I’m feeling like I believe you. You should let us know wtf happened because if they don’t have a justifiable legal reason for breaching their part of the contract, you have grounds to sue. I’m not litigious, but there has to be some law against withholding your control over your assets for no reason at all.

ARKG struggled to make a comeback today, despite the end of day rally for SPY.   SPY is due for at least a modest correction. It hasn’t even had a -1% day since **October**. If we see spy correct slightly back to $355, ARKG could deflate substantially back to $88.

Yeah that shit printed
For shares, they definitely make a difference in some situations. I'm down thousands of dollars on a trade because TOS opened 5 mins too late when price was at my breakeven point which I had a sell order at. In that 5 mins, price went back below my sell order and once PM hours started for TOS, price kept dropping. I was asleep the entire time. Woke up and saw price hit my sell but I still had my position, ugh.  But mostly, I use it to buy penny stocks since many of them run right when PM officially opens.
im in july 2022 leaps so i've got time but makes sense if he thinks its gonna fall further
Look guys I graduated top of my class in Dunkin’ Donuts online academy of economics ok I know wtf I’m talking about here

Merry Xmas Eve you filthy animals! Lost 20% of my port today but yall still make me smile!
Lemme get this straight: Canada stimulus pays their people $2k A MONTH?!?  Yo Americans really do get fucked in the ass constantly. The Dude does not abide.   Need some stimmy for options. I mean I guess I don’t really need a stimulus check. But it would be sweet.
I think it would moon even harder if millions of Americans are suddenly able to save for retirement/pump the shit out of the market
buy calls
Silicon Valley is why
Nearly Plus 50% week over week but yes let’s focus on a 2% down day.

What's the best dip on sale for Monday morning?
Asking about what’s the difference in playing STIC vs BARK? One is already there and other one will be listed as new tickr. Do I get the pump with STIC or wait for BARK?
If Mainstream media is covering stink gains, that means there's a risk that everyone is already leveraged up to their eyeballs.  No bueno for January. Flash crash potential high
We’ll find out soon

Look at the haters trying to bring ICLN down.  That’s a big 0.2%.  Good job Bear gang.    See you in January when we take this to $30.
It’s an active fund, what it’s holding now could be completely different in a month
Forreal. There was some bargains today though, CRSR, BABA, NVDA... good day to enter positions
Making a call on MTCH. An almost monopoly in a Industry booming in the late lonely Christmas time. Their next earnings will blow the stock out of the water.

Anyone following spacs shine any light on NGA and QELL?
Calls and a red portfolio
Any other good news you got?
Good for that guy
I Was rejected by McD unfortunately
You are correct
or you could have just short sold GME with all that money yesterday and got an near 10% return instead of 1% playing with a ludicrously hot, overvalued stock. Could have even sold short covered puts with the current IV level and IV crushed some retard super bear
Agreed, and thank you.  That's how I lost a fucking *ton* over this past year.  Total stupidity.  The next dumb shit I moved into was selling half at 100% and waiting for it to go ballistic, when I should have just taken my 100%'ers and been happy.  Most of what I lost this year were those two things.  I was profitable in *so many* positions and either broke even or lost it all.  Total fucking stupidity.  Well, maybe some of it was being naive.  Nah.. stupid.
ARKF is cheap. Its a slower to grow but you can look for 2 percent in 2  months and its guaranteed.
Isn't it wierd that most of these congressmen have MBA's from Harvard, but they still managed to run up a large federal deficit?
CRSP was down too it was just low volume
Only down $5K for the day   Today was a good day
[removed]
That'd be good for my port. I'm just saying to hedge for large January flash crash + volatility.  Do a remind me of this comment for Feb 1 or so.
Why isn't BABA moving anymore?
I have all my IRA and 401k shit in Fidelity, maybe I’ll just go there
can you trade on thinkorswim with a TD account I fucking hate the TD interface
Not in silicon valley though.
See you Monday bb
BABA at 220...   Holy fuck
when articles come out urging you to sell after going sideways for a month. were going fucking higher. not lower. higher.
Well today was awful.
imagine american brand capitalism under yang's UBI  it would be like that meme of the futuristic city
I'm suprised the 🌈🐻 aren't in full force in this discussion thread rn. They must be off setting the table for their wife and her boyfriend's romantic dinner tonight.
Yes. Calls up 30%. Shares up 6%. I liked what they were buying in that fund
[removed]
Lol 2k a month would be cheaper then infinite corporate welfare
\-7900
This sounds good.   I have 2 broker accounts. One for investing. Which is doing fine. I recovered a lot after Wirecard (had tons of it) but basically this account is my buy and hold account. Shares only.   The second account is my daytrading or yolo account. And there im like 2k up and 4k down, which results in -8k.   I gotta recover it. No pressure, this are not my life savings or so, nothing that will change emy life if i lose it, but damn it sucks.   Especially that 2k win, 4k loss pattern.   One advise I got, I think im gonna follow is - buy indicies CFD x20 on red days and sell on green. 2021 may not be so different from 2020.   It still sucks. Need to clear my head over Xmas, not think too much and fucking go into 2021 to recover bro!
ARKG is weighted like Chad in biotech companies, not virgin loss-exposure like SPY
Shhhhhhhhh
Will baba moon or dump on Friday? I’m thinking ccp give baba a slap on the wrist

is ARKG a good play
MSFT and 220 +/- 10
Baba likes to do both go up to tease and then dump
It's an actively managed fund.
So does BABA trade tomorrow in China
Heard that one already a few weeks ago
You morons didn’t really buy baba did you
When’s the last time you caught a passionate ass whooping and had your hat coat and shoes tooken?
dude market is closed tommorow... go back to sleep
Lol they got us so good 😂😂 they tried their best and it ain’t shiiiiiiiiiit
Coffee break. Happens every day around this time
Don’t underestimate how Chinese ppl value their brands, people or businesses succeeding on the international stage. It’s nonsensical they’d destroy their biggest company and let US get ahead. Unless MA becomes a radical, it’s all political theater as of now
Yeah I might be a scared paper handed bitch but you won’t know the shitty feeling of losing half your position overnight! So be careful!!
AMD 92 12/31 calls killed me today 😞
Let us pray
Only lost 100 bucks.  That's close enough I guess.
I’m so tempted to buy in but it’s had an insane year
Yeah bro TDA made think it swim. The TDA app has the daily, weekly, monthly graphs tho etc
#Friday is Christmas you fucking atheist
hold on let me just call Xi Jinping to see what he says about that.
It would look like the Robinhood illustrations of the "future"
after hours and with a bunch of people buying 1-5 shares, it likely won't move much. Action begins again Monday morning.
Exactly, if nothing changes he might be right but I don't see that happening. I get the daily newsletter from ARK and they add and remove stocks on the daily.
Hahaha
Canadian money isn’t the world reserve currency so they can devalue their money all they want
That's delivery not takeout
ready for that too. 400. 365. 400+?

30 shares and calls
Buy every dip.
I was just being sarcastic :(
Stim got rejected just so we could have have more stim talks going well. Extremely bullish
Looking back it seems to dump mid to late jan.
We get it. You have puts in ARKG. Who are you trying to convince, us or yourself?
Lol I’m so out of it. Is this one of those don’t mention it and jinx it type of things?
That's basically a green day
have you ever seen a rocket ship heading to the moon? 🚀 🚀 🚀
#Some retards on this sub think that the market is open tomorrow 🤡
As a former bear. I know bears are still fucked you’ll see Monday
I’ve seen this story on BABA too many times before, falls 15 percent on CCP news, and stays flat until the next leg down. I am cool thank you
Consolidation in the 20s is fantastic
Fuck I’ll get in on it. What’s your positions
According to Cathie, her G fund will likely be the best performing one next year.
Like we just had two monster days and the little shit is talking shit about a two % red day. Must be new poor or just poor
Where my 🐴BIO gang at?
great day to buy for next week
COVID and BABA ruined my Christmas
Calls 🙀
Raher be paper hands than empty hands
take some hits for me too.. this year has been absolute trash, i would drink and do hits too but cant with family in the same house
He ain’t wrong
Gotta feed the monkey, man
i'd argue that the pandemic has been *better* for small business that non-pandemic.  all these people who had never heard of small businesses who are now bitching about the government not helping them were never going to shop anywhere besides walmart and amazon anyways, so their customer base hasn't declined, so any stimulus help they get is pure profit. it's unfair really they deserve *less* help
hmm i played stocks only. bought around 80.
Few grand into BABA calls several months out
Did I buy at at he top?  YEP   Did I make some good tendies?  NOPE   Do I have paper hands?  YUP   Is my wife gonna fuck me?  NOPE
Exactly, yet identity politics and idolization are at all time highs...turns out it's quite easy to keep the plebs down.
I mean it's technically takeout with a middle man. I just paid $100 and the uber fees totaled like $8. So it's still $92 for takeout.
There's a conflict between what MS wants in their deal (physical stores) and what he &amp; this new activist firm wants.  I don't get his plan to try and turn gme into a version of steam, but ya maybe it'll work.  Should be volitile stock either way!  Good one to play the ups &amp; downs.  I got 1/15 19.5p, fingers-crossed it dips.  If it hangs out flat a bit might grab a call - if they can oust the CEO or take over a few board spots that should be good for another pump.
Why would the people who bought today be morons? Do you know how many people were holding it at close last night? The people who bought today got a better bargain then most.
Who would have thought CIIC would be the most consistently green stock in my portfolio.
You have both COVID and BABA? Damn, you need like exorcism
UBER eats is a funny transaction where all four involved parties lose money at the same time.  -Uber loses money, no surprises there.   -Drivers lose money after accounting for gas, mileage and everything.   -Restaurants lose money because of huge fees and cuts.  -Customers lose money because of fees and tips.
Lol for free, guy makes millions off his pump and dump boomer show and promotes his insider forum non stop

Who bought the dips today and ready for Christmas rush
So glad FUBO is tanking they’re the reason I missed the bama game
definintely one of those forever poors.  break even selling = winning.
WTF?
If the stimulus passes, Apple is gonna moon. I swear I see Tik toks all the fricken time about how “why would you buy the Apple headphones, instead you could buy 4 Apple stocks”. I swear if the 2k stimulus goes through half of the white girls in America ages 18-30 will buy at least one stock of Apple
who cares about 1 company? they can let this drop to $180, strip their market share and spread it across 100 companies, that would be better for brand value
Same
Victory screeech
Loaded up on QS and XL!
You are a retard.
AMZN better moon on Monday
Lost 17% net value, mostly on a large BABA call collection, and I had to make tough decisions on what to sell in my portfolio to be able to double down on BABA. Twas no fun
Yikes. Man didn’t realize how precious his time is
They are all broke
# **BUT THE ARMY NEEDS MORE TANKS**
Hey if past performance is any indication, you know how to time a dip right. You’ve got more balls than I do going in today lol but I’m looking to get back into BABA as well in the new year. Good luck to you too!
Uber actually makes money for basically doing nothing. Drivers earn pennies. Everyone else is sucking a big red dildo
If the goal was to lose money...I’d be a very successful trader
2k in kanuckistan money is like 1500 usd

I wasn't paying attention. What was the spy open at...-3%?
Fukk forgot to close my dec 24 options. They were OTM.
Actually frightening.
Now this is investing!
Matched with a girl on Tinder who said she wanted to peg then I said something wild and she unmatched. Fucking blew it 🥺
im not half the man I used to be
The fuck happened with BABA lately? Haven’t been paying attention cause I don’t have any.
Yes in fact I’d say ToS is the primary way to trade with TD
NKLA puts are better than sex
Opinions on MVIS? I doubled up today on the dip, smart or stupid play. I got greedy and didn’t sell 2 days and missed out on some nice tendies.
Nice confirmation bias
Would be pretty messed up if BABA 200 becomes the new 300. How many people thought it was a steal when it initially dropped into the 280s in early Nov?
I heard there’s a country that blocked people’s pandemic relief money on Christmas Eve. I feel so sorry for their people, must be some poor shitty third world country.
Made 1900 today and for me thats pretty neato. Merry Xmas autists
I feel like a significant portion of GOOG ads are bullshit. If you search say “Target &lt;product&gt;” often the first result will be an ad for Target- but you were already planning on being a customer! Clicking that makes it seem like their ad worked. A lot of people will just click the first thing rather than scrolling down to the unpaid search result they asked for. Obviously sometimes a competitor shows up as the ad, which would be the intended goal. Wonder if companies will catch on that a lot of their ad spend is bs
28 percent on spaccccccs
If you give it the same P/S valuation that BBnB has it gives GME a 28 value. That's 20% on the upside.
Just being pinned by MMs at below $28 for options expiration.  When options activity is cleared the SP will move higher with ER in February. Own shares.
😂🤣😂🤣😂
not as retarded as all these fools bitching for the mom and pop shops they'd never even heard of before  let the failing businesses die

A perfect storm of shit
If they were OTM they will expire worthless
Chin up buttercup
Why can't Jack Ma just "disappear" and be replaced by someone more competent yet😭😭😭😭
Customers don’t lose because they’re obviously willing to pay in exchange for not having to leave and pick it up themselves. That’s like saying someone “loses money” by buying a TV they want.
Ali byebye
They’re being investigated for anti-trust violations in China
Went all in BABA calls expiring March, probably a bad call idk we will see next week 😪
You be riding the rails?

XL is going to rip Monday. What price did you get in on?

If Americans really want stimmy, why not just raid Congress?  Why sit and wait for it to happen? For a bunch of angry ppl, I find the lack of mobs disappointing

is STIC a pump and dump or not? people are saying SIRJACKALOT sold his position after the pump today but how would they know he sold it?
Cathie wood bought that dip bro
But he would stick it out with his hands on his hips and be really proud of it
He shout have said alibaba inbreeding and then he would have been spot on....
F
Long term hold Arkk and Arkg it's an etf not an individual stock lol plays by different rules
Why did spy pump? Stimmy passed?
THEY ARE BETTER  IT'S NOT AWKWARD, EMBARASSING AND DISAPPOINTING.
What does shopify do other than facilitate websites and payment structures for dropshippers?  What % of customers customers do they have that aren't dropshippers?
We're too fat and complacent   Everyone is sedated with pharmaceuticals, overfed on junk food, and fatigued from a sedentary lifestyle
how have SPACs not been purged by the new direct listing method. warrants for most of them are above $2. $2 for recent SPACs that haven't announced a target and wont have to until 2022.
Dont care about loan forgiveness. I knew what i signed up for. I want some kinda of education, employment initiative like more focus on technical, trade schools, training programs that lead to stable jobs without needing wasting time in college. Too much gap between graduating high school and delivering pizza and the high cost of college that makes it out of reach.
The cheap prices were the real Christmas gift
All I know is someone from China jumped off a bridge after seeing Babas price today.
I did! I bought shares. I had luckily trimmed a majority of the position already after the earlier drop
I was thinking the same thing but was too much of a puss. Maybe Monday
More competent? He called out Winnie, that’s why they’re being assholes about it. He’s super competent.
I'm up 11k thanks to shop and Tesla, so he probably had Tesla haha
I dunno about y’all but I was slaughtered today. Am I the pig??? 🤡🤡

\*\*Insert clever 'American Idiot' joke here\*\*
For now it’s just a pump, only time will tell
Yeah those business models are baffling honestly. They rely on the customers being lazy and overpaying massively for food, and also somehow convincing employees to work for chump change at best. It's crazy and will not last at all.

can someone help me out with options i’m pretty new to it but i’m lookin to buy some pltr calls and get some tendies any advice would help
Idk I think it's just some power move. Girls are big into soft feminine guys now

Haha I bought GME at $13 couple of weeks ago ... went to a game stop today to buy a game as thanks to the 40% + gains !
Everybody’s got choices. I choose to get money I’m stuck to this bread
If they are OTM they will expire worthless and you will keep the full premium. You shouldn’t be writing options if you don’t know what you’re doing
Virtually everything was really down
Nice. What were the premiums on those?
I have positions in 19 tickers across different industries and 2 were green today.

Fuck DKNG I’ve lost a lot of money on calls that were like a dollar or 2 OTM with like a month till expiration and I would just bleed every day hoping it’d go up
Reading through the comments it seems you retards still think stimulus is happening. How many fucking times will congress keep dangling this out there and people still believe it. There is no 2k coming your way, now not even 600. Everything between now and the next Congress in January is just a song and dance so that people don’t start marching in the streets.
GME $12 on Monday you mean
Checked my RH recap just for fun. I made 840 trades between January and July. But more importantly, I earned 43¢ in dividends.
I’m fucking killing it in my Roth. Up 17% since 11/4 with only 60-70% or less even actively invested at any given time  If only I was as uninhibited with my main cash brokerage account...only up a little over 6% in the same timeframe  The main lesson here is yolos are rewarded. Don’t be a pussy
It’s all digital bro. Better off looting a target
Of course but still a consideration
What the fuck am I supposed to do tomorrow

I bought 700 shares end of day.  Seems like a decent entry point, I agree...
I know people made a lot of money on zoom but I really can't personally bring myself to invest in a Skype clone with so much competition in that space.
Last chance to hop in XL before Monday.
Lol what did you say that was so wild?
What caused the DOW to close so high? Everything I’m in tanked and then traded flat until close
I can't trade TSLA because I know management.   I don't wanna get anywhere close to the SEC.
$BABA is the grinch in disguise fml
Unloaded my Jan ICLN options for 500%+ gain. Bought a leap on T. Kinda thinking about just being another 50 shares of T so I can do covered calls.
How is nio gang feeling? Think we’ll pop on Monday?
Well I wrote wrong sorry. It is ITM. Wtf will happen now is a mystery. Happy Xmas
I would love to fucking see the behind scenes with Jack Ma and Winnie The Xi.   With subtitles
Alibaba intelligence more like alibaba inbreeding.... Fuk u Ma
BLNK is so overvalued
Down 55% on $300 Nov 2021 BABA calls  Any hope for these?
I hate being in a cash position. Like, shit. You don’t know if any news gonna pop over the break!

General's chicken cuz its time for a coup

Hey i think about buying into abr.v came across that the got some good results from soil samples. Anyone got any thoughts?
Average down
Someone bought 150 million in baba few minutes ago 😯😯😯
Props to you for owning your mistake, you will probably make it back
****LETS MAKE THINGS SIMPLE****  BELOW are two links for SPAC lists and mergers   You make money on these run ups it’s no secret.  G H I V - will run tf up next week! IM TALKING GREEN FKN candles.. and will continue up until it’s January never (a steal)   I P O C - this is a bit pricier for calls but my F’n GOD this explodes 1st week of Jan towards its Jan 6 merger. I’ll sell on Jan 6 morning and I’ll buy back in once it dips that day.  (Honorable mentions: FCEL PT: $20 by end of Jan and PLUG will fly with its huge battery conference Jan 8  Let’s get rich. Don’t take this comment lightly. I’m up $378,000 since June and my go to style of DD and mentors are spot on.   Oh and yes MT will print in Feb don’t worry boys.    *****MERRY CHRISTMAS FELLOW TARDS!*****   https://spactrack.net   https://www.stonks.fyi

What a strange day for me
Do cocaine
Feeling bad man
The markets will be opening back on the 28th right?
I’m done wearing sneakers outside the gym
Good news: broke even for the year  Bad news: can't deduct my losses
Me too, but I also am retarded enough to expect it to see a v shaped recovery.
It never does before holiday. Next time I’m gonna sit the whole Holiday out so I don’t lose that 10%. It’s become a holiday tradition
It's really not. They move shit all the time. It's simply a result of good management
Everyone in wsb would be successful lol.
Why?
Once your account goes down to $500, you are dead. 99 % of the time no comeback
Its a total gamble.

I was just saying it looks cool.   Shut ur broke ass up bruh
Is purple the new color for Christmas?
Don't forget A P X T. They merging with Avepoint. Overall strong play imo.

Bro wtf lol  Once a meme stock reverses...GTFO immediately
Carry forward 5 k every year
What are you holding?
[removed]
Jack Maoooommmmmmmm!!
best bet is to go OTM at the early point of a WSB meme train.
There's no premium for covered calls. I do monthlies and still only get around $0.40 or less for close to the money.
Deep OTM downside protection seems like a good idea for Jan 1 through Jan 31

Tell him to get all the nursing home buddies on the GME train, nurses too.
I’ve been down to $100 then back up to 5k 6k and took profits multiple times. It’s a pain in the ass but it’s doable
Huh? Do only poor people trade outside of retirement accounts?
I'm gonna start a company called Pyramid Scheme Incorporated where all we do is print and sell shares. The more shares you have, the more dividends you get from the revenue from future share issuance. That's it. No gift shop or anything. Literally just a pyramid scheme.  Who wants in on the IPO?
Now kith
Oh yeah? I sold my 2000 shares of blnk back when it was $7 and I sold my 5 $5 1/21 calls in August.

To have a salary in the first place is a sign of success.
12/31 50c lost 75% since I bought
No, but they trade on margin accounts like big bois
If you bought leaps.... you weren’t being greedy. You’re just waiting for a better opportunity.
Sure but why celebrate it in the DAILY thread. That's yesterday's news.
My internet  been down for 2 days now... fuck you spectrum
Bought a buncha FDs today without realizing the markets closed early today and aren open tomorrow. I just thought the calls were cheap 🤡
If Barnes &amp; Noble hadn't been delisted I'd say to buy puts on that shit.  They told me to wait outside yesterday because they were at capacity.  FORTY PEOPLE.  In a giant book warehouse.   I did not wait.

This is the dumbest shit i've read all day
Good job. $120 nikes impress no one

PRPL gang is mostly disbanded at this point.
**shoves finger straight through dolls asshole til it blasts out of its stomach**
Interesting that you say that. I have the same intuition.   It's funny, this move could be your big profit opportunity. Buying deep OTM puts as downside protection is very profitable when their is a big move downward. Trump transition presents this risk in and of itself, in addition to the other concerns e.g. market ATHs, stimmy issue, defense bill issue.   Good luck!

Jack Ma just said merry shitsmas to BABA gang today
It's always prices in haha
I guess that's why the calls I bought were very cheap.
u know it's been a rough day when ur eyelid starts to twitch
Oh ouchie wowie just opened up my portfolio after driving all day to the the MIL’s house. Double whammy, time to start drinking.
“Washington Redskins go fuck yourself”
Upvotes for ICLN Monday?
I wouldn’t invest either. I was just in it for the earnings play. That went wrong.
Ah yeah my bad it is a margin account.   Makes it even worse because I’m taking like 50% margin there to get 1/3 as good of returns as I’m getting in my Roth that isn’t even fully invested
lol trust me I'd prefer it wasn't a pandemic, we are down 60% on the whole year, PPP money ran out months ago and we probably won't get the next round for a couple months.   &amp;#x200B;  that being said our online sales have 3x'd this year which is great but not anywhere close to the revenue we had last year
Stimulus talks going well green all next week
That's some super villain shit. $1 mee-leee-uhn daw-lers.
According to Theory of Evolution, all the FD purchasers will be wiped off wsb completely at one point and only share holders will survive.  We are on track to become /r/investing by 2023
I’m in the bee with 700 shares and 1000 warrants. Sold 25% of position when it hit 20. Went in 1000 shares 1000 warrants on STIC. Gonna keep riding this wave till it stops working
[removed]
Ended up down for this week. Not ideal. Thanking my lucky stars I had zero BABA. The fuckery of SQ, PLTR, and SE was a force to great to fight this week. Most calls at least 2 months out, so praying.
Anyone else’s RH after hours fucked up? Mine says down 0.6% but it’s been up 0.3% since 1:00.
GME *upvotes
Just look at his head
Jokes aside, he’s probably looking for ways to get out of the country somehow, must be shitting his pants, poor fella

When youre waiting in line at the drive thru, pay for the guy behind you. Make sure he’s the only other car so that when he looks in his rearview mirror to pass it forward, hes fucked and now has to carry that karma debt all day. all Day!!
Damn. RIP to you too
That's what I'm saying man. No it isnt exactly like LMND but same addressable market. Could run up to 20 within two weeks
Everything ok at home Jim?
Post positions bitch
Holding bro, holding
Eh she was a poser anyways then. Talking a big game about fucking men's asses, but probably not woman enough to get it done.  If one little comment spooked her, then your asshair and sweaty musk would have freaked her out too.

Fuck I love buying stocks. I get to sit at the table, take small loses, take small gains, never deplete my capital and live my life through you wsb big dick slingers scrapping your scrotum through broken glass chasing those 4m+ GME gains
Ill buy my xbox/ps5 there!
A shit blizzard Randy
JD that one kid crying silently in the corner hoping the teacher doesn't call on him next.
How are stimmy talks going? :(
No need. I got April $15 calls deep in the puss* I just hate how unrealistic sheeps are over here.
Also, don’t rush and buy it all at once, like split it in 2/3 and buy dips!
Different for everyone. Gotta meet your *basic* needs (not wants), everything after that is great.  But I think your question is the wrong question to ask
Get out 🔫
For people who want to get into TSLA, but you’re sacred:  Tesla is a good buy ( for long term) no matter how expensive it is now(wait for dip tho). I see so many Tesla in Hong Kong today. I always knew Tesla is quite popular here(not a household name, but often mentioned in local forums) but I did not expect Tesla to be EVERYWHERE. Considering the fact that Tesla is not cheap, and there are so many cheaper options, seeing that many Tesla is mind-blowing. Can’t say for sure but buying Tesla dip never do you wrong. It reminds me of Apple (iPhone4 era).  But if the market crashes, your money 💸💸💸.🤡
fuck it, I'm going to play winter basketball, it's pretty warm by me for Dec 24. Every year is warmer in december, in my area of U.S.

Anyone able to port an HSA account to a brokerage from your work account? Hopefully with option privileges?  My standard account offers some boring etf investments but I’m trying to turn it into a yolo account

Holy fuck my robinhood glitched when i opened and said I lost 5,000 for a sec

Yeah that was the mistake that fucked me over. Up $300% on 12/24 PLTR calls and then I say do do do fuckin gonna buy more 12/24 calls on today, this beautiful 22nd day of dec, and then I realized how stupid that shit was
If jd dropped today along with baba. I woulda been extra dead. It was close enough to no change today for me to unload some

It will be back on Monday
Fucked up my own rules and didn't sell in premarket on FCEL and XL and lost around $1000 in gains today.
Just an okay week, after all.  $157 would have been $40k for the week, instead I took in about $25k in gains (selling and closing CSP) and now I’ll own 7k shares of $ABNB at acb of $156.4.
You should try a nicotine addiction. Much cheaper
H&amp;M was trying to track me but apple didn’t allow it bought a share for protecting me
I sold FUBO at a small profit around 30. Despite the super run up after, glad I didn't get back in like two days ago. If goes back to 30s, I"ll rebuy.
I did learn a lesson, don’t buy calls the week they expire xd

yeah i'm sure some are definitely hurting i'm being at least a little bit hyperbolic. i'm just sick of seeing all these people on twitter who surely don't patronize small or local businesses bitching about the government not helping them. lots of the businesses being propped up are businesses that were struggling anyways, personal checks to citizens would be a better use of funds than that.  all this of course is definitely not to say megacorps should be getting any sort of help at all from any stim package

It ended up being a headache, the bank closed my HSA account which caused all proceeding contributions to get stuck in limbo for a while till I got it sorted. Funny enough, the transfer took like 3 weeks, and I ended up investing it all in index funds the night before the crash in March started.

If you didn't buy the traditional PLTR EoW dip, what are you even doing with your life? Literal free money
Yeah I fucking feel that man... Hopefully while baba is being fucked JD can find a way to sneak along the sidelines.
Same here. Shit my pants.
So you’re missing out on what, 1k of tax savings?
What % chance of stimmy before Jan 20?
Speculation is the name of the game buy the rumor sell the news lol hmm seems like they’ve got a solid management team something must be in the works, maybe not Proterra but something else? I need to diversify my spacs lmfao
dumb american prick kid
Nah fam that's a very high IQ move they ain't ready for that
If it's your first proper play take it easy mate, just get a appl/msft feb or march dated call ITM to test the waters, take the more risky plays on PLTR and shit once you're comfortable.
I’m getting bonered on my calls
Same
Just go jerk off to Big Ramy like the rest of us
I have no complaints with Schwab.
Still bullish on PLTR but I’m starting to think my March leaps aren’t going to print...  Someone make me hopeful again.
Noice dude noice ....
Get your ass out into that cold kids! We can all live in the car where we will be guaranteed to pass every molecule of air between ourselves many many times!

Wait until the market crashes(it’s inevitable), then get some. Tell yourself you’re getting it for your children, you’ll feel much better). I am going to hold for at least 10 years( if Elon is still alive).

What’s your strike price?
They posted that article a couple days ago and it went down and came back to where it was within a couple hours, those bastards just wanted shares for the low, but I don’t know why it got hit hard today
Go for 2022 leaps bro
I'm clearing my head too man, just go into it with your new mindset and you'll be good! I lost money, but it taught me about the type of investor I am, so now I can play to my strenghts and try to avoid my weaknesses
lol GME fatalists, a 2% dip on a selloff day after 50% runup, with half recovered AH already. Cohen bought 500,000 more at 16.02 just a week ago.

Preach atleast I’m getting drunk and not working
IF YOU HAVE A DECENT AMOUNT OF MONEY AND WANT TO TAKE THIS SERIOUS, DEFINATELY NOT ROBINHOOD.  BETWEEN ALL THE APP BUGS AND COMPLETE LACK OF CUSTOMER SERVICE, YOU'RE BOUND TO GET FUCKED BY THEM SOONER OR LATER.
It's a joke fam this whole sub is
Sounds like the worst day ever man I hope you are ok
Uncovering another dimension that’s been in front your face
The BABA dip shows that no matter how good a Chinese company is, they play by completely different rules.

Lol thats terrible. Hopefully you diamond handed thru  Do you know if you have the ability to trade options with it? Or does it only let you buy shares
ARK funds have ruined my sense of reality. G and K dropped like 1.5% today, but I'm sitting here thinking how I'll never financially recover from this.
Yeah it really is absolutely absurd.
What strike?  Might want to pick up shares. The lock up period is ending and could Be  in for a rough road
I'm holding this one long term. Idk if there will be a squeeze, but I think there will be a turnaround enough for this to go up a lot.
Zero
Xi is about to make BABA an example for other Chinese companies
Which fund?
Post it pussy
I'm doing better than BKS
Also left off IB
Yea looking to get away from them. Two morning outages back to back during one of the most hyped stock days last month seems sus. Done using them expect for play money
I'm in your exact position. Should we hold and be bullish by Jan?
Yah bro this covid shit got me depressed man was in a dark place. Finally feeling better, work is getting better. I had to close my restaurant biz down. Kinda got fucked from multiple angles. Hoping 2021’is better. Made and lost too much money last year probably lost 10’years of my life from the depression. Hope you’re doing well tho bro. This place can get dark fast.
Have you been reprimanded for mentioning the mod that left? There is a bot doing that now. Fuck.
Tastyworks all day
They just tryna scare us bro don't worry we will prevail GME gang forever they'll talk about us in the history books
Use Webull/TOS as screeners. Schwab for trading. Fuck Robinhood
Good day to buy for sure...
I may be red on the week but seeing NKLA just continuously die really makes me happy. I fucking hated Trevor and this fraud ass “dream” from the beginning. I wish I wasn’t banned on their subreddit :(
Bought 2x  $222.5 BABA calls when the stock was at $218.  At close I only had a $100 total gain.  Was that IV fuckery?  Feeling like the gain should have been about $400 with a .50 Delta.
the squeeze is inherent if it goes up a lot, the shorts can't just decide to never cover
You ever catch yourself using lingo from this sub in real life lmaoooooo
Someone ask me for advice they need true market wisdom on. I'm bored and want to take my mind off my positions
Gold bro. They have gold in the vaults
Guys help, i showed some gains to my parents and now they insist I invest their money aswell. They think I know what I do wtf
I had a fucking rona test this morning and it went late then got rescheduled after I drove two hours round trip. Missed the entire session and I'm fucking pissed.   &amp;#x200B;  That was my last fix until Monday. How the fuck am I gonna spend my time until then?

You fought a lot of med and small size portfolios who sold and algos so...not a fair fight
Understand the rules and you are golden. Ma stepped out of line and is getting punished.
Tip #1 If stock goes up, then you're risk also goes up. Try not to FOMO. (unless its Tesla).   Tip # 2 If stonk goes down, then start buying; stop being a degenerate and stop selling.
I'm looking at ICLN after hours.  What is with these big movements up. It happens almost daily. is that ETFs or hedgefunds buying in?
I was very bullish on JD getting to high 80s NY Feb and Mar, but I had to sell half of it or else I risk becoming poor if the unexpected spills over to HD

I say bullish af in real life
Nah I’ll hold a bit longer. Might trim it slightly
I called my boss a retard. Now I’m the boss.

I wrote the ultimate guide to IPOs for this sub in a past life but after being gone all year I don't recognize this buzzword going around. I think an explanation is fair enough
Gotta assume it’s the weekly call holders that are shaken. I’m as calm as a cucumber.
The only people who hate Jack ma are the China men. The amount of anti Jack ma spam in here should be an example of how much Chinese influence is on this sub. Also they have small pp so lmao
Ok so after years of just bending the knee and letting China get away with human rights abuses, Jack Ma speaks out once after all these years he has just let injustice slip by and suddenly he's a beacon of freedom??? That's like calling Nazi scientist who helped Hitler massacre Jews saviors just because they spoke out against the Hitler...
Since the recent quad-witching and TSLA being added to S&amp;P everything just seems off. Maybe it’s just me?
All in ARKG
Today, bears gaped my anus
Just buy them some ARKG. Its the perfect balance between explosive growth and safety
March is better than January. Buy some dips if you can. They have an event planned late January. March should print.

I believe that HSA's a treated similar to IRAs in terms of options - you'll need to get approved by your brokerage, I use Fidelity and am qualified to sell CCs on my HSA and IRA, but no other forms of options - but you can unlock higher levels of options. Just need a large account and to email with them.
Yea I totally feel that especially this holiday season! Instead of paying a little extra to the  local coffee shop they have a starbucks cup on their insta. I also think that most of this "small business support" is gonna dry up next year when the world goes back to normal.   &amp;#x200B;  I go back and forth on the personal checks: most people used them to save or pay off debt we need people to spend it!! Maybe lower the income requirement and increase the amount of the check to get the cash out into the system??

Yes, VALE is very off this week. Luckily my leaps aren’t too far OTM.
Sorry to hear that man it’s been rough year for everyone except Jeff Bezos and Elon, but especially worse for restaurant owners. The only pain I’ve had is the gym this whole year been a fucking challenge getting to one bc they’re all closed.   Yeah financially I’ve done okay. I’m close to breaking even all time *knocks on wood* how’s the girls treating ya tho?

Yeah  I'm bullish on JD as well, let's just hope while Baba gets fucked it gives JD some room to stretch it's shit. Hopefully this mess doesn't spill over tho....
I have 500 shares also that I got at $13 so still not the end of the world.

Aw man no trading for the next three days... I hate the holidays 😕
Too many of you tards in ARK ETFs. The play was better when no one here mentioned it and it mooned all year.
Bought the dip myself. Feeling good
What are you referring to?
The Virgin Fed - Works from home - Prints money at the problem - Gets bullied by Trump tweets  The Chad CCP - Probably drinks 1/3 the world’s supply of Remy Martin XO - Evaporates 100B market cap from BABA overnight cause CEO said naughty things - Wields people shut to stop virus
TSLA finna be messing up SPY returns for years to come since it's so overvalued... flat returns on SPY for a while.
I bought TSLA at the beginning of the week instead of QS, I know that feeling
That gay bear is also symbol of resistance to the cuck know as Xi. It's a tough choice, Be a communist? or Be a Gay bear?
I just told my friend that bears gaped my anus today over text. She has no idea what I’m talking about.
TBH I think BABA will do similar to CRM. Flat after the drop but slowly pick back up, you should be ok.
Yeah just be thankful you missed today.
You have 2 karma? Why would I disclose my Onlyfans money on Robinhood for you? I get free money from OF. Learn the way of the internet ho.

Can’t even short them they so small that’s why they short baba
no stimmy
Some of the top threads on r/investing and r/stocks are ones telling you to sell BABA AFTER this drop. No wonder they never make any money.
****NOW IM MAD****   Didn’t I tell you to fkn get into I-P-O-B???  Didn’t I?? Look at it booming! The shit will hit 30 before Jan 6 merger   If it’s too far north get G H I V   HONORABLE not spac MENTIONS (plug and FCEL are crazy fire sale buys)

I’m sorry I can’t hear you with such a little karma. Big karmas only please.
I wouldn't hold for long without protection because I don't see how they plan to protect themselves from general collapse of the market or society. If you want to dump you can, or you can hold for a little while to get a better price to dump at, but if you want to hold for a long time you should choose between either hedging the position with options protecting against a price crash or changing your mind about holding it long-term.
Maybe bcoz BABA is fuk!?

Sometimes the obvious play is best
It's amazing people are shocked if those funds ever drop 1.5% with RSI as high as it is.. they still don't ever expect a selloff...
That sounds wack. We don't have those in Kazakhstan
You win some, you lose em all🥲
Fidelity, TD, Schwab  You know adult brokers.
I will always harbor a hatred for $QS until the day that manipulated shit tanks hard
give everybody personal checks! some gets spent, some gets saved (essentially invested so pretty much as good as spent), some goes towards debt which then frees up other money to get spent. literally everybody wins
You do realize that TSLA is 1.6% of SPY. Even if Tesla goes to 0, SPY will only go down by 1.6%. Lol
Dont forget to claim the loss on your taxes. Uncle Sam giving me 3k to gamble a year is pretty nice, its just paying taxes on the front end if you lose

This goes against everything that happened today. Also, at like midnight last night I put in a sale on all of my pltr shares (26.53) the ten minutes later I cancelled my order. The market needs a ride through the year, too many big banks trying to make their 4th quarter look good.
I don't think its anything to worry about, it's a new ticker, can be volatile. I think when we get closer to Q4 results it'll be back up to 50s.

In my case because I broke my promise to myself to not get into any options positions to hold over an uncertain Christmas weekend unless I got a good buy in opportunity for gold calls. So now I'm sitting here worried about my options positions hoping they don't fuckin die on me because I went and traded something less certain than discount gold calls
so the guy that went from 6k to 100k in 2 days, bought monthly calls on XL  i just need to buy calls on the day an EV company closes it's merger with a SPAC?

I'm sorry JFK would like a word
This is the CCP we are talking about. They hate Western influence and require complete loyalty to the party. China chooses their billionaires unlike in the US.
I had a gf, back in the day
I'm literally short it right now lol
That stock is headed to the pinksheets. Hydrogen relies on electricity to produce so it will always be more expensive. The only reason why it was attractive was the fact that it offered greater range but now with battery tech, BaaS and solid state, its less of a problem for EVs.  Plus they got caught lying about their technology.  It's a Theranos.
Exquisite. Bonus points for it nearly being positive ah
Probably because America isn't at all like it's portraid on television.
I asked for help, got a DM and told them what they asked for then they called me a liar... motherfuck I asked YOU for help why would I lie 😭😭
I canceled my trailing stop loss 2 minutes before open lol
...and end up on a list
The nightmare before Christmas
Bought 100 more shares of PLTR today . Did I do good?
Oh hell no. Turning off auto update. Thx for the heads up and sorry to hear. Hopefully you’ll get it sorted.
BABA sale was a joke. Many institutional investors,  MMs were off today. What we saw - retailers panic selling at market price. On any normal day that would end at -6% most. Monday, when everyone's back to work we'll see helluwa fomo
Did your wife’s boyfriend tell you that?
Bought SPY at the bottom today, nice 40% gains
The year is 2025. House speaker Nancy pelosi's brain jar has agreed with Mitch McConnell's new human skinbody to vote on the $12 covid stimulus package. This is the 37th revision to the package initially introduced in late 2020. One dollar will be split between all americans, two between all illegal immigrants, and the rest to Jeff bezos. Due to stimulus hopes, SPY has rallied to 600.
How are those two things different, what are you investing in that you think is solid
If sharting your pants is cool then I’m Miley Cyrus
Why RKT?
They were probably organized by people making minimum wage and dropped out of high school so it’s not like they are going to finally succeed at something
Maybe they should've left out the Lesbian Dance theory advancement project in Pakistan.
My 1/15 35c are fucked. I'd sell them at a 60% loss but the only way I know how to play the RH mobile game is to 💎🤚🏻everything
2k here
If I were China, I'd hire Russia to do that shit

Homemade covid test / For free   Step 1: Open a can of beer and try to smell it   Step 2: If you can smell the beer, drink it to see if you can taste it   Step 3: If you can taste it and smell it, this confirms you don’t have COVID  Last night, I did the test multiple times and all were negative. Tonight, I am going to do the test again because I woke up with a headache (another symptom of COVID) and feelink like I’m coming down with something.
Gah I was just talking about this happening last night, those candlesticks were on a death spiral
I got slaughtered on CRSR today.
I wonder how these MMs are able to sell off PLTR every fucking opening. Paperhands are non existent at this point.
It’s a market economy run by the state/govt, not a capitalistic market like the US. Market economy serves to keep the people productive and working, not for capitalistic purposes.
Maybe text her to tell her you're long on PLTR.
How beta is it if I’m doing a long distance relationship
The entire point of the getting this done before Christmas was getting aid to those who filed for unemployment at the start of the pandemic whose aid expires the day after Christmas. I guess fuck them.
You know people have apps that can buy and sell through their phone. I dunno if you knew
Some guy already posted his loss of 10k today from naked puts.

If Congress doesn’t approve of a stim check by tmrw we need to barricade those fuckers in. They ain’t leaving till I get FD money
Solid company
Why is GME going up after a five year slide?
Skinbody McConnell has a ring to it
that's so beta it's charlie
block me then weenie boy
Account is down 3%, but my calls are down 42% and 18% respectively.
Got PSTG on monday after her larger order, up 40% for the 2 days so far and they still cooking (22.5c 2/19 @ 2.0 )
Is my ultimate fetish to suck dick with a girl 🤪 Problem is finding the girl who will and guy who will let it too lol
My cat keeps crawling on me and purring so yea I guess I’m dripping in pussy
Monday? Unknown. Is this the top? Probably not.  In the long run, if GME can carve out even a 10% of the gaming market and hold it down, it’s not going anywhere. Shorts initially started with a Blockbuster scenario and made good money shorting it on the way down. Now they most likely have to contend with a longer time frame.   Regardless of a short squeeze, I don’t believe GME is in danger of bankruptcy. What you’re seeing in the price action right now is a fight between shorts and longs. This shit has almost completely detached from trading with the market as a whole, indicating unique underlying movement and pressure.
TSLA hammered my puts shit
if you can't beat em, join em
Russia has nothing to lose. Their economy is always shit. China on other hand, their economy is intertwined with ours and other countries
If green energy is really a thing and coming soon why are Iran and China investing trillions in oil and gas explorations and drilling right now?
Omega, u gonna get a drunk snap of her getting slammed from behind
I have been loyal to CRSR. Minus when I sold to take gains... but I bought back in and promised I’d be good. Now she has taken everything back and I’m still hanging I there. Fucking bitch. Wake the fuck up on Monday CRSR!!!
As cuck
Oh good, thanks in advance
She’s not in a long distance relationship so
Palantir, this guy right here.
Baba gonna V up Monday?
Peak beta
Time to buy baba?
Just buy ICLN. Don’t over think it.
Skinbody Mitch
You really bet against papa?
Secret service would like a word
man I hope you're right
Oh??? What’s it called??
Keep dreaming
Anyone know what happened to DIS after hours???
Fuck no, that trash isn’t going to recover for months
she ded
Im a sinner
if you want to bet on China get MCHI. otherwise it’s too much risk
Just realized my CRSP position is up like 100%  Got in at 86 gang
Late to the party 🎉
 Just Make Sure You Survive The Tyson One-Two This Week.  You'll Need A Diamond Face For This One.
thing will go parabolic on merger. 50 easy.
Gonna rewatch Dave and get drunk fuck today
BABA trades tonight on HSI right?
Today was the last trading day of 2020 🐻💉
New paper hands form everyday
ChYNA
I'm here to play weekly options like a retard, not buy shares and pray something happens in the next 6 months
True, likely spit roasted
I was slaughtered yesterday and today. Call me the $PIG
I only know the power of theta these days.
UPWK is the next meme stock to do another 100% gain  You can try to deny it but it’s true
BABA has lost 30% of it's value in the last two months.   In order for it to reclaim former ATH at 317ish it would need to see 42% growth.  Do with this information what you will
bro...?
ye bought back in too and it sucks
I hope so. 60% down
No it wasn't
Looks fine
Can you picture hedge fund managers, pension funds  and market makers managing funds with peoples money through the phone app, without their bloomberg terminal and any research? You think that would be legal, dumbass?
Looks flat AH
It’s a boomer stock pumped by a boomer, they always move sideways
sorry for your bags man
So Puts?
No?
NIO dipping on BABA news. Clean play opportunity now through NIO Day.
Volatile stock and the market overall has been in kangaroo mode.
Congress already passed the stimulus you dolt. Trump has to sign the omnibus bill into law for you to get the $600. The $2000 is not included in that and is a separate thing now.   Basically the government will shutdown Tuesday. If it shuts down you’re getting no stimulus. If it doesn’t, you might not get stimulus.
Would def be nice if hyln stopped being garbage
 not actually true bro lol
China is going to teach Ma a lesson
Looks like next week is spac week
You’re an idiot
Dip at 2:25
I read a DD about the market being down today. Is my app glitching because it shows all markets green?
Lol how is that possible it’s near all time highs
That’s not true?
2025
When I was younger I thought the stock market was some crazy Advanced thing. Now I'm deep in it and enjoying it and making money. Not a lot of money granted, but it's still wild to think I'm a part of it
Market was much more chill than I expected today. This is insanely bullish. The market will continue to be fed at a higher rate plus another injection. I’m glad to see investing become mainstream and practical. Tech ironically has made it so much easier to invest therefor pumping tech.
She's getting dicked down all the time lmao.
Yeah no shit it's run by the state. Just wondering y Xi would want to devalue one of it's most valuable assets and stifle the entire nation by doing so?
I’m sorry Johnny there are no presents this year because I invested in a Chinese company instead of America
Spy +4% open on stimmy hopes
Yea you fucking cunt. I know you are still checking the market... you fucking addict
Dip at 2:25 to 117.00
What’s your margin interest %? Fidelity charges me 6.58% I feel robbed
Puts on this guy’s relationship
It’s a offensive when people call jack ma alien head man.  Like come on man
Yah bro and on top of all that shit no gym. I’m in Canada so the lock downs have been harsh here haven’t had access to the gym for 3 months now. And working out at home isn’t the same, so I’ve gained weight as well.. can’t see friends can’t see family it sucks balls. Lady is fine lol still with my GF supposed to propose soon, wanted to do it outside of out shit city but we can’t even travel anywhere so holding off on that. Lol what a shit year. Happy you’re almost at breakeven bro. I’m still a ways away right now. Can’t believe I was up so much before lol makes you humble tho
All I want for Christmas is HYLN to not be hot trash for a week.
No
I wipe my ass with a $600 stimulus. Trumps gonna veto the stimulus if it’s $600. What the fuck is $600? Half of the utilities bill?
No. Calls
noice
Jack ma off please
Too late for puts tbh
bold move
Cocaine take its toll man
Oh probably some person sent a bad market order AH.
dude cmon now that system of valuing stonks went out the window with tsla
You will get cheated on and it will end
In your opinion what are the best dividend stocks to invest into right now?
Anyone silently riding up the FUSE warrants? 3k at $0.91, 120% and not even any news yet.
The potential is there but it just so fuckn disappointing
Yeah I’m barely down. I’d even say flat. That DD is looking at irrelevant data. The world has changed in 2020. The stock market is a new monster.
Investing is finding companies with good long term prospects for generating revenue and holding positions for years at a time. My current plays here are ARKG and ICLN, I expect those to 2-10x between now and 2030.   Gambling is trying to play shorter term trends, take advantage of investor psychology, looking to ramp up risk for greater potential reward.   Unless you have incredibly disciplined bankroll management, gambling in the way WSB does is a near guarantee to go to zero.
DASH looks like it might run next week
Why doesn't CCP just flat out take BABA - they are communist, they can do whatever they want.
Sounds like elevator down next week with trump stimulus veto.
Lol imagine being happy
Unless you have hundreds of thousands in that, you’d never know. (Also maybe you do?) Disclaimer, I am very retarded
I know. It’s like my kids.
What’s a good entry for FUBO and what price can you see it reaching in the next year or so
you feel robbed because you are. RH charges 2.5% lol
What is even happening with PLTR I feel like it’s gotta be the most manipulated stock out there rn. Of course I got calls on it
TPL if you have a big cock
After it ate all the cmg?
Kids, unwrap your presents early we're taking them back to the store. China made them and now they're taking them back.
What's the ticker for China?
time to sell covered calls on PLTR until my cost basis goes to 0 and the stock is still trading at $25-$28 next year
Haha that’s gold
lol
So should I leave this sub like the mods
If you're in the Christmas giving spirit, don't forget to toss a few tendies to our boy who gave us [WSB Synth](https://wsbsynth.com/)!
Congress passed the omnibus bill already. Trump either signs it, vetos, or ignores it until the congressional session is over on 1/4. Then they have to pass the bill through congress again.   The $2000 stimulus is separate thing now.
CCP
GYNA of course
Look at all dat head, all dat head inside dat hair
What's considered a dividend stock? Literally any stock with a dividend or does it have to have 1% yield?  If it's literally any stock with a dividend, it's MSFT, AAPL, and NVDA.   If it has to have 1%, it's probably JNJ
Getting dangerously close to 25k in the Roth and the glory of tax free daytrading  Debating just depositing and extra few k in to pass the barrier and taking the 6% penalty hit just so I can do it now
I feel seen
Why, you won't hold it more than a week anyway.
This old ass news being passed off as some new shit got my heart rate spiked https://www.barrons.com/articles/gamestop-investor-ryan-cohen-buys-more-stock-51608836334?siteid=yhoof2
It's just nice to feel something again, it's been a hard year
She 100% cheated already :(
Jan 22 became quite affordable today. I doubled down to protect myself by adding one of those and one Jun, both with crazy Low targets of 250,260
uh I think you're thinking about fundamentals like P/E forward ratios. I am just noting facts about the magnitude of this price movement. didn't make a statement about valuation or sentiment, where do you see one
Keep shorting TSLA, prepare to live in refrigerator box next to dumpster.
Loose assholes are a given for someone with the ANAL GOD flair
Guess I should have been more clear. High yield dividend stock.
I heard fidelity give 4:1 margin thought most brokers do 2:1
was a rough fucking week. hopefully next one santa rally smooth sailing green tendies to all
Jack Mama better make me filthy rich by 2021
RIP quarantrader.   His gravestone read:
At least you’re not borrowing from TD at 9%  RH really trailblazing with 2.5  The only one I know beating them is interactive brokers which I believe lends at 1.65% or something like that as long as you have 25k min
same
Santa how did you find the spirit of Christmas in your heart?
It’s Christmas Eve, I don’t see my family till tomorrow, it’s too cold to golf and everything else is closed. Well shit
You day trade your Roth lol
Is it Monday yet?
If I had millions I would park much of it in ATT (T).  7.25%, not going anywhere, stable.
I don't feel anything when I make money and feel like shit as soon as i lose 2%, is this a loss-loss game now?
I’m just sayin nothing follows any rules anymore.
What’s your buying power?
AVGO is best growth dividend stock imo.
Name confirms telling truth.
Nope just as retarded here with an even retarder portfolio
[removed]
Wanna loan me like 11k so I can be in the same boat? 🤤
I think I’m the only loser holding PLTR and NIO calls 😞
🍺👏
Hell yeah that’s what it’s there for right
Dont act like you know me bitch
100
Go shooting Cowboy
I'm up a lot 🤷‍♂️
Live savings in FCEL, VLDR, NIO, PLTR, SRNE and BFT - how stupid am I
I spoke too soon. Afterhours brought me down -$10 lmao
No it just says buy SUMO
4.20
I spoke too soon. Afterhours brought me down -$10 lmao
is there literally any real reason to be long-term bullish on GME besides Cohen? lol. I hold some shares cuz I am rehtard but I'm wondering what the narrative is here. short squeeze yeah, what else?
I’d be up 115% if I didn’t try out options on CRSP. It just broke even last week. This seems like the perfect stock to do CC or CSP’s with. It’s got good premium and low volume
I need to just park my cash &amp; let it sit. Took a big loss last week so I’m looking just let some shares grow and focus on other things
drugs
Drugs
You just jelly because you don't have a tramp stamp like myself
For Iran, it has relatively inexpensive fields, so investing in oil makes sense. I'm not sure what the breakeven point for China's fields is, but I assume it's decently low.
Hope so
What do you mean? Schools are closed
You can deposit for a 6% penalty? Sounds like a bargain considering there will be no tax after that
If you’re not UPWK gang then you’re nothing to me
Serious question - why would Apple even want to make an EV? Where is the service revenue stream associated with the car that they have with a phone or other handheld device? Seems like making home appliances would make more sense than cars.
Oh you support GameStop? Name every game.

you’re not alone. i’m down 35% all time rn...
[removed]
Run to $60?
If Its All To Expire Next Week.  42% is a little steep to be holding With Less Than 5 Days.  I would settle take, back capital and go closer to the money when its this volatile.
Feels like a gambling addiction, it’s why I wanna stop trading
Forget FUBO invest in FUBU even white people wear that shit. Theyll only get bigger heading into the 2000's.
I lost money today. Merry Christmas retards
Puts would habe printed 5k% today
#Nothing says Merry Christmas like screwing over the American people  #I’d piss on Mitch McConnell’s grave

#I CAN DO THIS TOO
I think JNJ might be like 2.5% off of the top of my head and it's almost impossible it tanks in price. Not sure if that's high enough for you. There's of course like JPM too as the best bank.
Disney did slap cheeks over the past few months due to something I saw on the news (too lazy to look it back up).
Sum ting wong?
Last Christmas I gave you my tendies the very next day you yolo’d away this year to save me from tears  I’ll meet you in the Wendy’s dumpster
A lot of WSB memes other than TSLA were red today, which is where the panic you read here is coming from. But the overall market was not bad.
this week yea, today was a soft -6%
In need to work tomorrow in the morning. , some xannies to get some sleep. Some beer to enjoy, won 1 k today I’m fine
[removed]
Yeah if it’s just the 6% I’m definitely doing it but I think it’s more complicated than that...like you may be liable for gains made off that excess contribution. Haven’t dug deeply into the code for it yet so not 100% sure
Lambo or shopping cart 50/50
lol did the same today
Take a look at margin rules for retirement accounts.  Yeah, you could PDT on cash, but you'll probably have a bad time, particularly after a couple of GFVs.
Today was meaningless. Xmas eve shit
Holding those as well. Godspeed brother 🙏🏼

What's more likely:   1. China says, "just kidding, you guys can buy the dip now" 2. China says, "you fucked up, Jack, *we* are *still* the Captain.  Go sit in timeout while we figure out how to make an example of you"
[removed]
We’re not China. We have a dem pres with a boner for green energy. Literally has nothing to do with what’s going on over there.
lol ok sure, fine. I concede that point. I'm still gonna use the information I have when I can. otherwise we are literally just throwing our buy orders at a dartboard and hoping they stick. even if it doesn't pan out sometimes, I do research on principle

Calling it...republicans will shut down the gov on Jan 4th.
Hmm let me see... maybe the biggest demand in the history of videogames for new consoles? Hmm... maybe a very experienced and competent CEO that will have tons of cash to turnaround a business in a booming sector?
-$775 on ARK calls today. Could’ve been worse all things considered.

Yeah good point...I already accidentally got one GFV without even realizing it. I can see that being a problem

Growth stocks in general got massacred today.
Truth hurts lol.
Only got 5K invested. Nio, palantir, PSTH. Workhorse and Fisker are my big plays. Should I reach 10k in the upcoming months?
And Nancy’s
I need Pelosi to come out and speak so I can see those melons 😍
Dip buying opp
Dua lipa
Depends on how beta your mind is. I’ve seen alphas power through LDRs
Well...nothing just Cohen and short squeeze. Thats pretty good tho
Well maybe I’m just a dumb stupid idiot cause I just deleted the app and restarted my phone then downloaded the app and logged in and everything seems fine so hopefully it was just a glitch and no harm done. The update doesn’t seem worth it either lol happy holidays bud have a good one
Nio is great but I wouldn’t play battery day.
That’s what I was thinking also. I want to wait until my NIO shares reach 100-200k in my Roth then drop it all in T and let it ride until I’m ready to retire.
Becky Quick is such an obvious bitch  Would love to fuck her up the ass and yank her hair back, spit in her face

Baba
I just sort of stopped trying a week ago, the 12 hr Uber shifts have sucked every ounce of ambition out of my body. I have calls but I’d have to open the app to see what they are. I’m pretty sure they won’t print. It’s kinda house money anyways. Nothing matters.
Damn I’m at 23.09 hahaha still green baby

The dip was the stimulus. Hope you bought more
NVTA got whacked
put $400 into BABA   anybody expecting China to actually regulate the market &amp; punish Alibaba is a clown
today was one of those up 20% days but held too long n ended -6% ... fuck
Dude they’re so fucking big I wanna squeeze and suck on them so badly
[removed]
[removed]
That's pretty good, but a great c-suite and bullish macro-trend is necessary but insufficient.   For me the sticking point in their business model. how do they see growth going forward when most games are downloaded from online play stores and most consoles are bought online?
R/investing told me to avoid BABA, so of course I went all in because that means it bottomed out.
You think that’s bad, look at what happened to pltr
think your over diversifying.. you only got 5k better to go balls to the wall on something your extremely confident about
Don’t forget the entirety of congress
Getting anally penetrated by BABA here
Is anybody else buying the fdx dip all the way down? Maybe this is a revenge trade for my failed er play
Wait you own PLTR? Ok, name every piece of data ever

I held only JD fd's, bought yesterday before market close. Was sweating premarket but was lucky to sell with profit around 10am. Later bought only 1 baba 237.5 for the next week just for fun.

NIO will have life my young scrotum
Ibkr offers great rates but their margin requirements are so high you can barely use it. Not to mention their crazy auto liquidate feature lol. I swapped to TD just to avoid all that since I don't use margin much anymore anyways.
Why FSR tho. I've considered but by the time they have a viable product they'll be in a crowded market, hoping people are willing to rent their vehicles and their shtick on the greenest EV will be a large enough economic moat to differentiate.
I feel this bro
My gut is getting big. Any body weight exercise suggestions? Other than push-ups

Bought $10k of dip today
FREEEE JACK MA !!
so when's ackman gonna announce Subway as the target for PSTH?
I donno which is the worse play  Buying the CRM dip or the BABA dip
“Target became a prominent example of another kind of personal data vulnerability, when the New York Times detailed how the retail chain analyzed shopping patterns to determine which of its customers were probably pregnant. Target then sent them ads for relevant products, in one case outing a 15-year-old girl who hadn’t told her father about her pregnancy.”   Lmaooooo I didn’t know this happened to target a couple years ago, fuck. Lol

Ima give u some advice. Take it or leave it but it worked for me. The one day you take off - use that day to go on a hike. Preferably somewhere there is a payoff at the end. Go to Alltrails and just search for some shit near you.  It’s not a fuck ton of serotonin or anything but it’s a lot less soul sucking then watching your calls expire otm. Just makes the 12 hour grind little worth it when you planned a cool hike end of week u know?

Winter is coming. Might not be a viable option everyday
The advice goes 'inverse wsb' not 'inverse investing'
Take your time when you pick out a couch. It’s crucial.
So what’s going to be the next money making play? The past couple months it’s been ipo’s, spacs, and ev. It’s not going to work forever though
Oh damn, yeah I've never used ibkr as a broker...only recently looked up their rates after RH cut theirs. What is this auto liquidate feature?
Jesus who are the idiots who got FUBO at $55-60? I hope no one here.
Got 130 euro up. But think to hold it for longer

Burpees is a nice combo workout. Also, jump rope for easy cardio.
Drink less beer and more water maybe also eating less won’t help at all you need to eat more greens to speed up your metabolism and lose belly fat
Yes...because IV is very high.  Do you know what happens to leaps when IV goes down?
CRM ho 5 bucks from the 220 lows. If you had 300 shares that's 1.5k in a few weeks. 🐢 &gt; 🐰

watch your diet, especially your fat and carb intakes. You’re probably eating too many calories and not burning enough. Crunches are a great way to burn belly fat.

Oh yes
I still see money in cool spacs. Ahem weedmaps 😇
Cramer getting unhinged by all the BABA bagholders mad at him.
No mods and you're in the wrong spaces if you getting dumped on
They did IPO via SPAC so you got in at the bottom.
Ordered a 3070 on newegg my package 2 weeks had UPS 3 day delivery. Arrived today but im not home and it said signature required. Got an email saying it was left on front door.   WTF UPS
I bought the dip for mommy Cathie  #Simp4Cathie gang
I thought PSTH is a good one. Also got bft and btwn. But want to sell those and get that money in nio or PSTH
Thank you. Just wanted to point out I don’t drink beer, and I drink alcohol maybe 5 times a year. That’s not really what’s holding me back :)    Greens is a good suggestion! And water intake.  Thank you
We all broke bois
Gonna exercise my options
Did you buy the massive BABA dip?
ZM dip been bad too
The way this works is not understanding and just go with the flow. Otherwise you're rational. Don't be rational in an irrational market

FUBO reminds me of FUBU
It's up like 10% this week. I'd be more nervous if it didn't pull back a little.
REALITY:  1. LOSE NET ON MEME STOCKS 2. EAT TWINKIES FOR DEPRESSION
Yes I did
Lockdown? Or baba
Only SPAC I gave a shit about this year was QS
Become a bull.
Icln + ARK*
Rockin’ around WSB, at the after hours thread, BABA hung where you can see, every retard bought the dip. Rockin’ with  our girl Cathie, bagholding ARKG, later we’ll have some GME, Elon handing out fresh tendies   🎄🎁✨♥️ Merry Christmas Everybody!
I must be on the naughty list to lose money today...

PLTR and spotify weren’t spacs
Get tinder platinum, fuck a bitch
Just saw his tweet. He recommend deep ITM calls on BABA? Lol for sure he visits wsb since that's literally the same as shares but he chose to use the word "calls" in his post.
Sorry not everyone lives in shit hole America
No. Take him, kidnap him, and lock him up in some gulag somewhere.  Just leave BABA alone under different leadership

Yeah. Jun/Jul calls. Not too worried. Grabbed another ARKG and will continue to grab more if we see more red days.

Yea
Oh how I wish I could reverse time, would dump my entire net worth into BABA fd 250p yesterday

Merry Christmas!
Wouldn’t touch BABA until it’s clear that Jack Ma is in the good graces of the CCP again.
Fubo actually tight
CRM got chopped up. No clue what that was about. Fund having to unload?
Going to hit the Christmas party on 4 hours of sleep, strong microdose, and getting wasted. Hope my family disowns me finally
Just reading thru the WSB rules... Doesn't this whole GME thing directly violate #3? I mean thats literally the gameplan with this thing right? Buy up enough shares to force MM's to cover their shorts and send the stock to the moon?
ARKK literally pulled back 0.98% but that's a massacre here.
Ups been a big let down this year bro
You need help
LOL
Lol both my birds left the city for Xmas
I don't know about that with Georgia running offs coming up. If they lose the senate they're fucked.
Loaded 3k into FCEL calls exp Jan 15th... payout isn’t bad if it hits 20 bucks
5k%?
😂😂😂
It’s always a bull market if you’re looking in the right place.   RMG, STIC were up 20%+ today. QS was up 4% BLNK up 13% today.
E-commerce already represents more than 20% of their top line. They already have a deal with Microsoft in place. They get a cut of every digital purchase on Xbox they sell. And I believe this may be just the start. Besides, on fundamentals only, their current e-commerce sales (meaning without new consoles yet) already justify a 2 billion market cap
See you in Vegas beta bets
wow..  i would have a panic attack over that
Just spit my drink out
Yeah you're far from fine mate
I didn’t see anything 👨🏻‍🦯
When does crm dip breakout my ass needs help
They don't have margin calls they just start selling your shit lol.   And their requirements were insane it was like 75% of value for Tesla stock while I was there. Made it impossible to daytrade shares on margin. So it all looks great on paper but in practice it's pretty much useless since you can't really utilize it as much as with other brokers who are more laxed. I rather pay a higher percentage for when I want to use margin rather than pay a low apr but have barely any access to it.
Either I’m a genius or I’m fucking retarded. Holding $375c’s
Find a third
100% for sure
So are we done doubting G(HIV)+? Or are we still hooked on the sexy girls in the room? I hope yall got in on the pre-holiday dip, might not look back from here.
ALPP has made my Christmas 🚀
It’s kinda like The Lord of Flies situation right now
Surf
NARC ALERT
I don't understand why so many people use margin with such high interest. Ibkr has great rates, even Robinhood is now 2.5%. why not switch?
I agree with all of that except you can’t target fat burning in a specific area. Crunches will burn fat yeah, but it’ll burn fat evenly throughout your whole body.
No
Merry Christmas Eve, ya fuckers. See y'all next week for new year rally.
You also need at least 10k steps a day it’s very important, cool more, got out less things like that. You want like 4 good lean meals a day that were actually prepared. Sorry I use to work at a body building meal prep place and telling people to eat less is the last thing they need to hear lmaoooo
I haven’t been alive during a bear market yet
anyway amazon go up next week?
There are no rules her anymore boy
This sounds way better than my Christmas party plans
yeah not bad at all...
Amazon was the best theta stock over the past 6 months.
Eat less
Merry SPACmas to all! 🎅🤑
bro CRM just gonna stay range bound between 215 -230 til the end of time
buy the dip or will china bury BABA
Man Im bored already, and I ended the week on a net loss. Guess I'll just pretend Im happy and festive till monday.
Not for free dumbass
So many times this year Ive woken up hungover and had a covid panic. Lesson not learned.
Back in the day when I bought my 970 UPS pulled the same bullshit.  I came home and someone was on my porch playing with the package, ran off when I got home (it was a little kid), and I emailed them and they said they were under zero obligation to do anything.  I should’ve said something but I was just glad to have my GPU.
Pretty solid right?
The Third Day on HBO makes for some triply holiday viewing
Thanks man. Merry Christmas to you and your family. To many smiles and lots of laughs 🍻

I lost money on them already sir.
Not if they didn’t vote for biden
Three days a week I go to the gym for 60-75 minutes and disable my investing apps. It’s been a game changer. Even when I open them and I’m down I’m clear headed enough to not over compensate and make emotional decisions. Can’t support this idea enough.

This is the way
You don’t know my age
My sincere hope is that Monday turns red, mixed at best, because Trump has made no indication whether or not he's signing, and Monday is the last day before a potential shut down. I liquidated a good chunk of my portfolio and I have orders placed but they're not filling.
cramer actually suggest buying options? i never hear him say that
Just saying the wrong publication does a piece about it and then Reddit admins may have to shut us down or something to do PR control
Do your best, and you can build a really good routine if you can get access to a treadmill and a tablet computer to walk while streaming Netflix/Amazon Prime/Youtube/Twitch/whatever else
Just need another week of 10 baggers and then maybe I’ll owe some taxes
Damn that sucks. For like 5 months I was driving an hour each way just to work out at this one gym here that was open and had no Covid rules. No masks nothing. But the gas and time was killing me I could only go in the morning bc of work and then I’d miss the whole market day haha.  You guys living together? No drama? Lots of couples can’t stand each other after being home alone together for a whole year lol.   I remembered when you were riding that SPCE wave to $40 lol
So how long can I drag my ass on handling my taxes until I literally go to federal prison? This is my first year not paying someone to handle it for me lol
SEC now allows direct listing. Can’t wait to buy companies  that make no money but gets pumped to the 🌝🤑
Will ARKK just keep rising forever? God damn part of me wants to just go all in and forget about it for several years.
Usually a strike with no ticket ends up being SPY 99% of the time. Totally SPY though lol
Direct listings, in my world of Corp business dev viewed similarly. You’re right though
Same here. I always thought it was something that only rich people did. Now us poors can participate and become rich too!
GOEV to the moon 😩
I was really hoping this wasn’t spy
Idk I just had to get in on that baba dip with some calls
Pretty funny, yeah. I just googled ‘trumps nipples’ expecting some weird shit but it was Ivanka with high beams
The kids out there have brought $GME —which is losing $0.29 per share—back to prices it hasn't seen in three years, back when it reported profits of $0.59 per share.  lulz
#BREAKING:  elon said fuck ur puts
Agree. I really love hiking and it's a good reset. If you tell me you were state I could give you some recommendations about where to go
I could and was tempered to do it but a -5% or +5% day could easily blow my entire account
Why the spy hate?
always look out for the plays wsb doesnt mention. RKT it is
Ah yes, I understand. Even Ibkr crashed a while back. But with Ibkr you can atleast call customer care (24x7) and close out position in an emergency. It's been good for me so far.  What about Schwab? Heard great things about it, and customer service is good too, or so I've heard
Lots of spacs with good leadership still on the table
Breaking, Jack Ma removed as head of BABA, Chinese government sentences MA to serve his prison term in traveling circus
That $600 is tied to the government funding bill. If he vetos it the government shuts down. So the people trying to keep you alive during a pandemic will stop getting paid.

Exercise can improve things for sure but doing one meal a day or eating within a small window of time, say 4-6 hrs, should help.
Who gives a shit that GME's largest investor increased their position?   Investors can still be wrong, and often are lol
PSTH is a great one but u person ally don’t see an announcement until March. But that’s the long spac everyone should have. But if you look at the two I mentioned above they will easily shoot up. Both January mergers. They’re great companies so I’m holding through merger but even if they were Doo Doo companies, the merger run up is always there

Fidelity has been absolutely stellar for their consumer service and their very well-built platforms. No complaints just wish the interest can be a bit lower. But now def feel better learning about TD’s 9%
This thing is up 15x this year, if it hits 20 I’ll be blown away. It’s not another SPAC
Go look at Cathie’s most recent post on Twitter. Their “ARK big ideas 2020” deck aka industries they are bullish af on.   Get ahead of the pump boys!!

I mean he could be right, I'm not saying one way or another.    I'm just saying it shouldn't necessarily be bullish news. Because he's not infallible. I don't care what other investors moves are, because they can still lose money just like me

Well it’s actively managed, so it doesn’t technically have to go down except for management fees... It dipped in March! So it’s not infallible 🤡

Yea the less positions you have the more time you’ll have to research them and go in depth. Also NIO has a big event in a week or two and if there presentation goes well it could easily rally. Up to you man it’s just my personal style to never have more than 5 positions open at once (currently have 3)
Follow all of the ark dudes on twitter if you wanna learn how smart people think
I would climax
In that case, why not call them up? I've heard from many people that you can actually negotiate a better rate. If you've been with them for long, perhaps you can convince them how much you like their platform and neg for a better rate  Not sure though, but worth a shot
RIP Rich
If CHWY could announce they buying STIC for 5x value that would be great.

Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the sub, newbies they joined this ill fated club.   The bots retarded words have forsaken, the masters they serve feel overtaken.   The bears tossed their ropes high up in the trees, They wanted to go with aching bums in the breeze.  The bulls were nestled all snug with whores in their beds, While visions of tendies danced in their heads.   On SUMO,on ICLN, JD and Titan.  Bears prepare bum, no pillow for bitin.

I know a rich dude who owns biggest hospital in Florida, cEO or something.   He is vegan.  He must have access to raw data or something..lol

Sounds like wife material
Cringe at people who still talk about PLTR. This shit is dead.
¿Por que no los dos?
ARKG is the way
If everyone knows about the possible short squeeze on $GME doesn't that make it less likely to happen?
Lmao @ Citron thinking they can pump like us   Boomers just never get it
BUFU
PTON now has around a 50B market cap, which is only a 2B less than the market cap of DAL + LUV (the two best airlines, neither of which will go bankrupt).
In the town where I was born, there was a man who flew to mats. And her told About his life As he massacred a bunch of bears
I’m naturally not a submissive dude in any way... I’m open minded and I guess I can see why dudes like it in the ass even if they’re not gay but imma pass on that. I’d be too ashamed, personally. No hate, js.
Nah man... Not ur niece. Teach the cunt about options next time and maybe it won't be so insufferable.
Jesus christmas
this shit is work. why the fuck do you want more work hours?
Spreads
Oh bro...... that hurts. My cost basis is $0.68 I would have averaged down on today’s dip but idk. If we don’t gap up I’m likely ditching these for salvage.
If it helps, I don’t use margin so I don’t see anyway this is correct
Balls deep in Cathie 😏
I’m tired just watching at him.   Thanks, will give it a go
God speed
What dips did ya buy?
Follow Gary Black on Twitter. The guy is on point with TSLA price action. A gem, don't tell too many people 🤫
When said investor is 35 years old and founded a 40B e-commerce company, I listen everything he has to say
Yes that is 5000% for those who dont english
Absolutely no reason for it to close. We can trade pretend currency 24/7 but not gamble on options
All I want for Christmas is the market to be open
Why such  high target price though.
That’s exactly what they want us to think.
You better hope it rockets back up. Issue is IV is so high it could go up 5-10 bucks next week and your options might lose money/stay flat.
Cresco labs shares
I would be very happy to break even. Godspeed brother, you’re in a better position than me
Credit score is dumb as fuck. Mine is very high because I recklessly spend with my credit card
no not really. I have worked with special ed children before and it is not something everyone can handle. Springing that kind of responsibility on you is inappropriate imo
Just get a gy to do it 🐻
fire departments?
I hope BB and GME blow up next week
Wow we should also let the billionaires and millionaire vote for us as well! What a world that’d be. Total utopia right?!

FUBO is going back to 25. Shares lockup expiring jan 1st. You have been warned

WTF alibaba ffs it's ecommerce and cloud compute, those aren't supposed to go down
You were born 5 months ago?
come on bezos, announce a stock split you son of a bitch
I'm still trying to figure out who pays for shit that can be downloaded/streamed illegally so freely.
Sounds like it’s very low
Gonna watch Home Alone, Home Alone 2, Die Hard 1-3 in a row
PLTR gang get leaps. I have LEAPS, stopped playing weeklies. It’s a long term stock now.
Look at market cap... they did massive buyback last year. How old are you? 3?
Nah fam
If you aren't poor sell puts, you can outpace the fund
on the flip side. if the anti trust suit breaks baba up then its over
Can we all agree to short mainstream media, they keep on keeping the public in fear and it's fucking up my life so they can make more money. Just when the vaccine comes out mothersfuckers be like new strain of covid just to keep viewers watching. Like fuck you, I keep coming in and out of depression and I'm afraid in one of my episodes I will harm myself. I will kill my oppressors before I kill myself.
I like to know bear and bull thesis before I go in. Any ideas?
It hasn’t fully marinated yet. I’m up but not up enough
Merry Christmas. See you guys on Monday.
I am down in Atlanta area for the holidays and it’s a very different climate here than what outsiders (non Georgians perceive from media reports). Outside of few cities, it’s all RED in this state. Atlanta and it’s surrounding neighborhood will vote for Dems but even among Dems, there’s a split here. For every 8 political commercials on TV, 5-6 are all Perdue and Loeffler attacking Warnock and Ossoff. Ossoff is being called a liar and that he can’t be trusted. Perdue running fear mongering commercials that if they elect Ossoff, Dems will defund the police, increase illegal immigration, raise taxes etc. it’s shit show down here
I’m going to start a financial research company’. Maybe like BTFD Research or something.. and just tweet vague shit about companies I wanna buy with some ridiculously low PT, and then a year later come out with a piece saying they fixed their mistakes and they’re worth a buy now...  Basically citron but more often for my homies
"hey boss can you just cancel my holiday? I don't need it."
I always start my day off with a balanced breakfast! 2 cups of caffeine and a trip to the toilet. My mind, body, and spirit are as one.
And Ireland is the home of tech companies these days. Being Irish-American I’ve been thinking of moving there. I was in Dublin this time last year. A friend of mine spoke at Trinity.   As a side note I must say that Irish cuisine is vastly better than I had been told. Restaurants there left me speechless. I thought it was all beer &amp; chips.
Rest In Peace for next week - FUBO
It’s been known for 6 months at the bare minimum that this could happen
&gt;A gem, don't tell too many people 🤫  b r u h
Not flexing as hard as you guys but about 2k in calls Feb, April and July at various strike prices
And prepare for when they report profits above 1$ per share next month
Sir this is an Arby’s
Suddenly 95% of the sub becomes ineligible to vote
no he just started christmas sale
Lmao
I’m introducing a new term to our dialect.  Jewbagger : making a 50-100x return on a single trade
ARKG is free money
Hoping you get that strong gap. If it goes south consider legging into a bear call spread and get some of your premium back.
Well I pay it off weekly but they don't know how much I'm overextending
So relatable
Someone claimed amzn was going to post numbers next week for the board season and that usually pops it a little. Could so be undone by macro garbage though.
I don't do much all day but I feel productive when my portfolio is green

When does it close?
I’m thinking of Doing An options Call on MSoOS
Nah it’s a pomp n domp
We’re all meeting on the moon, see you there. 👋
i love cathie wood but man i wish arkk wasn’t mentioned in here 24/7... i use arkk as my safe haven and come here for ideas for other plays that i’m probably not yet aware of .. can we start a new page that’s all about arkk (which is a retard-proof play) and just talk about potential 10 baggers in here ?
That’s hot as fuck
I’m new to call options and have 12/31 $53c on SNAP. Should I pull out now and take the loss? If it doesn’t hit the strike price will I lose it all? Will I lose more if I hold? Sorry I’m new
Need some confirmation bias that my big position in Donavan mcVAXnabb was a good play and it’s on its way back up soon.
I’ll go in 30k if he splits
No, it makes it more likely. People are less likely to sell as they anticipate a squeeze. It’s also attracting buyers.
Ty
Yeah bro, I honestly have found that getting the news from straight financial channels really cuts through the bullshit and opinions that other outlets give.
Lethal Weapon is also set around Christmas.
not really the person to ask but, i would say it has limited risk becuase the book value is pretty solid and idk abt the rest of the business though. should look into that further
Don't listen to this guy. Keep buying my weeklies pltr gang. Maybe next week it will moon! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Canoo shareholders need a life raft today.

Smoke a cig on the toilet. Next level
lost 5% today on a green SPY day. christmas is ruined. returning all the gifts I bought
Pretty high bar, I have an excellent credit history and carry very little debt but have yet to crack 800, close but no banana.
Fucking Melvin. If you work for them, the fuck are youdoing with your life?
Don’t know yet....first quarter next yr
Looking to enter another SPAC - any suggestions?
Yikes. Only thing they gonna pomp is an etf
My credit score is only like 780 despite paying all debts on time and using a credit card that auto debits for all purchases. But I’m 20 years old and I haven’t taken out a loan for a car or house so I’m out of luck.
He said the stock would pull back 10% after inclusion and we are still flat
so it's best to wait till Monday to buy dip? I don't think I will ever see BABA 216 Again, so i bought Jun and Jan 22 there
Head and shoulders.
If you hold until 12/31 and SNAP is below $53 all of the money you put into that position is gone

No because we have precedent now jewey
Trump executive orders go brrrrr
I think you're overly worried. My team handles tesla's account and with millions in spend a year. If the sec was cracking down on people like that, every enterprise salesperson could be compromised

Which is that?
Everyone’s going to eat up BABA come Monday.  Those that bought calls today bingo bingo bingo.  Those bag holding calls, keep on holding🥴

That will happen the day he grows a full head of hair
As you should

Make sure you get your fingers out of the way when holding the beer, made that mistake

New Providence Acquisition lookin good
[removed]
they also have a shit ton of debt
cathie wood   safe haven   Pick an average tard in this sub and they could be performed just as well as her this year. She would not last a month in a bear market.
Yeah stupidity makes me mad I guess. Is that bad?
You belong to the WSB cult. PLTR, ARK are sub-cults 😃
Got GME puts today, see you phaggits at $15.  😆
We need a Christmas miracle
Did some c*nt analyst really say FUBO is an 8 dollar stock? WTF!
U down to ur last 3.5k , thats not a blow up! U hit a 10 bagger, u back in the game. Dont pussy out and make it all back ++
&gt; Should I pull out now and take the loss?   Depends on your risk tolerance   &gt; If it doesn’t hit the strike price will I lose it all?   Yes and no. At expiration yes, there's a break even price. At any point before, no you can sell it for profit/loss regardless where the ticker is  &gt; Will I lose more if I hold?   Unless you're selling options, no buying them you only lose what you put in   &gt; Sorry I'm new  Ban
lmfao 2:1 warrants share redemption
Anyone have a link to when the PLTR lockup ends????
I personally think the ARK spam is a good offset to the PnD spam, but it might be useful to have an ARK page
santa rally prevails!!!
Stop being a pxssy, borrow from your 457b like me and YOLO it. 13K at 4.25% with 120 fee for 5 years. Payment like $245/month. If you can't make 245 from 13K, I'm speechless.
Next week is my week! My bull spread is a 370p and all week I WATCHED SPY TEASE ME FOR ALMOST 3 WEEKS NOW. good thing I have patience! I’m gonna print lets goo!!!!
Lmfaooooo
Fuck and marry Cramer, kill the other two
Yeah the closer to the expiry date you are the more the contract loses value depending on how far away from the strike price
What you do is make a wild call and then close up shop if it doesn't hit.  Start a new company and try again till you get a winner. Now you can boast about how smart you are and how everyone should listen to your company.  *this is probably illegal and you shouldn't do this

Ok thank you. I didn’t realize that and threw $500 on SNAP calls lmfao. Down like $85 so I might just take the L
Trying to decide b/w leaps and shares.  I think shares is the way.  You don't have to fight Theta.  Stock can take years to break out.    Although leaps, you are controlling more shares with lot less capital.   As im thinking, shares I think are the way.   Those ridiculous gains that hit the front page here are 1 / 1000.   The others are getting gang banged by Theta and Gamma finishes them with triple orgasm.
Can you go to horny jail please we are only turned on by OTM FDs
Financial times and the economist have some of the best journalism out there imo—of course, they’re behind paywalls 😬

Narcos probably up your alley. First season about Escobar is fantastic
You guys think ARK is vulnerable during a bear market may be right, but I know cathie and she’s going to go all cash gang right before a crash
I don’t celebrate Christmas. 👳‍♂️ Stock market open up! It’s racist, sexist, and homophobic to other cultures.
Merry Christmas,  ya filthy Autists.
WSB should run a Stimi 2k FD contest. Once we all get our gambling money person to make the biggest return on a FD wins a giant green dildo.( I will buy and ship hulk dildo to winner).
I heard the outsider is really good
this perfectly confirms my bias
You need a lot of credit cards btw. I only have two and am stuck in the 700s.
My guy. I’ve been playing this shit since it was 10 dollars. Friday’s are always dump usually. Followed by Monday’s where there’s a morning pop. Then you have Tues-Wednesday where there’s sometimes a nice rally.   There’s too much opportunity cost out there for people. I love the company but it’s the truth that there’s plays if you’re looking for a quick grab.   Good luck.
I looked at it yesterday and decided against it, so at minimum +10% Monday
Oh, also, Perdue running a commercial that he’s been “totally exonerated” from that insider trading investigation. You see it at least 3 times every hour on TV. It’s crazy

It's a game-changer. I skipped the Spider-Man pushups and the plank knee Ins at first, and I just did my best on everything else. It took about two weeks before I felt comfortable giving it a good run through. But even if you have ass this workout it's still a gutbuster

BABA 2/19/21 235c
I’ve been in ARK for months. When it gets spammed in here that’s when you know you should take some profits.
Literally everything i’m in (BA, CRM, HHC) was blood red today. Just a nice little a Christmas fuck you from the market.

I guess it depends on the situation. You’re definitely not responsible for someone else’s autistic kid, but you’ve also gotta handle it with kid gloves because I’m sure   1. Your gf is very protective of that kid, and  2. She was testing how you would react to the situation.
Peaky blinders  Game of Thrones  Succession
can you do a thousand crunches tho
Then don't use options pussy. But in all seriousness it's better to just roll it out of your still believe in the play, like I almost never do weeklies. You won't get a 10 bagger but you also won't lose it all
Yes. This is the way. I graduated medical school to forgo practicing medicine for this 😌
If you're paying it off every week it doesn't sound like you're overextended
Just use it like a bank that gives nice interest
Lmao
I meant percentage wise. The average tard on here has like $300 in their Robinhood account.

Friendly reminder to be outrageously generous if you can around this time. 2020 was an absolute shit year for me and so many others, but I live a blessed life because I have a roof over my head and food on the table. Giving to those that are suffering is quite possibly the greatest feeling in this world next to love. Merry Christmas/Happy Holidays everyone.

Bahhahahaa same boat brother. I do school too but it’s online and now the semester is over.  I couuuulllddddd get a job, but I don’t neeeeeeeed one. Thought about bartending too lol. I miss Fire season.
Last time i watched peaky blinders it was really slow 😅
The mail is fucked.  I am in NYC. I ordered a package from a supplier in Philly on Nov 30th. It was shipped Dec 2nd. It has been in the black hole of "in transit" since Dec 5th.   I literally could've walked to PA, picked it up, and walked it home to my apartment by now.

Yeah besides the virus of course the economy is usually booming, lots of money in the country! Country is polically and ideological very safe, stable and peaceful. Just an all around Nice chill place to live to be honest.. Although the weather is fucking shitttttttt. Things have also gotten very expensive here in the last 10/15 years due to the amount of money in the country. I'd recommend anyone moving here stay away from Dublin its the exact same as any city in Europe ( but way uglier imo)   Its nice having the government that will help pay for things such as healthcare, college, very good welfare support system etc.. Just makes you feel.. Idno.. Safe? Now because of that system we pay high taxes which sucks but id rather have it this way imo  Yeah haha our food here is just pretty much a mix of all the other world cuisines with some of our own dishes ( not many stand out Irish dishes at all lol ).. Like if I was to eat out in England I'd get nearly the exact same food as I would in Ireland! People say our food is boringly unoriginal because we just use so many other countries dishes but atleast as a visitor you wouldn't struggle to find the exact same food / dishes / restaurants  you'd find back in America! Today for dinner we made an Indian dish and yesterday and Italian pasta haha!
Icln
Government shutdown coming Monday...
Ban this guy mods. Spamming this thread with BS a bunch today.

Now because of that system we pay high taxes which sucks but id rather have it this way imo  Yeah haha our food here is just pretty much a mix of all the other world cuisines with some of our own dishes ( not many stand out Irish dishes at all lol ).. Like if I was to eat out in England I'd get nearly the exact same food as I would in Ireland! People say our food is boringly unoriginal because we just use so many other countries dishes but atleast as a visitor you wouldn't struggle to find the exact same food / dishes / restaurants  you'd find back in America! Today for dinner we made an Indian dish and yesterday and Italian pasta haha!
Nice dude
Never got into lethal weapon but will try again

Lmao Republicans NOPE’d the $2000. Don’t think we’re gonna see a lot of Ma and Pa shops anymore in this day and age. Given how much “support” this government has provided us.  Death of the middle class.

Don’t catch a falling knife. Wait for it to lay dead on the floor before you pick it up.   Or go full retard your choice
There’s like no talk about it though. I’ll mention it to people and they’ll be like wtf and buy a ton. Someone needs to do a DD I don’t feel qualified though.
Succession is phenomenal.
Puts seem too obvious. Therefore calls.
What you described is literally the situation that DCA is designed for. Don't do it if you don't have capital to spare though.
The parks are still very lucrative and by all accounts should bounce back with people desperate to get over lockdowns and restrictions. And their commitment to making so many new shows will not only elevate Disney Plus in the streaming market, but the Star Wars brand as a whole.

1. Iran about to attack the US embassy in the Middle East on Soleimani’s death date beginning of January. Can see Trump starting a war right as he’s on way out the door.  2. Georgia run-offs occur. If Dems win, run for the hills. We’re fucked. Dollar to die, market to die, everything to die.  3. Stimulus arguing AGAIN lmfao. Can see this not getting signed until Biden is in office.  4. A lot of people about to get kicked out of their houses / apartments bc eviction’s can begin occurring again.  5. We are just overall at generally overbought levels. Just look at the Russell 2000. Most managers anticipating 5-10% pullback.   Personally, IWM $185 for end of January looking extremely juicy.

She has good stock picks, but I gotta be honest I'm a bit disappointed with trading strategy/timing.  Idk if she makes trades herself or some other ARK employees, but buying SHOP and U at the top the other day (for ARKK) didn't look like a very smart move...  Saw it at cathiesark.com and was like.. bro why

A marlin fishing trip for my dad and a boat ride to the Bahamas for my mom. Going to walk around the city giving hot mcdonald's to homeless folks.
People don’t realize there’s a wide range for skill in the medical profession. Good doctors are very much noticeably different from bad ones, a lot of people in the industry don’t really give a damn about patient care it’s just a paycheck to them.

Thank you Jerome for destroying any prospects for middle class americans. Fucking housing prices up 20-40% since feb, salaries effectively 10-15% lower, while goods prices are going up. We need deflationary spiral to clean this all up.
Made $150 bucks today. I hate this short day holiday bullshit. Since when did taking something away a good thing. People can trade from home during the holidays. Open it up!
Guess what? Yes, I forgot the market closes at 1pm and left a bunch of short term puts open.   Oh well.
I think a lot of people are going to be disappointed in the long run. QQQ &amp; now QQQJ can be a great alternative with less fees and more consistency.
Go to Denver and find the sketchiest neighborhood.  You'll be the only one speaking english.  I don't know what it was, or exactly where it was, but I had some bomb Mexican food in that neighborhood and the service was spot-on.

Yeah just unsure how long that positive news and request for more trucks / or catalysts will take to see if holding is worth it. Hopefully their customers order more trucks to show the tech works. Just don’t know how long it will take. At least i have April ones?  Think it’s worth the hold?
Buy puts then
Here you go with the butt stuff again
GUh
Saaaaaaaaame bro, but calls.
Yeah but their growth is coming from digital, parks are just the steady revenue generator in the meantime

It makes sense that you'll have to pay tax on the gains otherwise sounds too good to be true
Hahahahaha I do forget this shit is an actual job to folks and keeping it open 24/7 would forever fuck them.  Eh, fuck it... fuck them... KEEP THE MARKET OPEN 24/7!!
They are protected by the UK they are a grandfather level company, they are also adapting to the modern market and with brexit over with finally they will only rise during the recovery. They have a huge upside potentially a 10 bagger from shares long term 1 to 2 years max

There’s amazing Mexican food in those areas. Go look on Federal Dr in Denver lots of spots. My favorite was Los Carbonsitos. My cheat code for finding new taco spots was searching Google maps for “panaderias” or “carnecerias “ and looking in that area for places with hand painted signs.

i guess yea its 2022 though
So this baba thing is a probe. This shit happens here with tech companies. Did FAANG plummet no. I guess the difference is this more of a capitalist system than China and so there will never be any breaking up of monopolies. In China there’s a possibility. Although, I would guess highly unlikely because politics is the same everywhere. Those in power are influenced by those with money. Baba won’t be fined or broken up and will be ATH once the probe is over.
I do think iran tries to make noise either with some aggression or opec stuff
I have to admit I’d prefer all the social programs and higher taxes. Funny thing is I pay Hugh taxes in America already and I don’t get shit for it. The weather was shite.

Most likely up. 3 day weekend so people don't wanna tie up capital, get back in Monday.  Also, Stonks go up... so the bigger the break the more likely it's green.

If you’re stressed you prob have too much money on the line on certain positions. Decrease your average trade size.

Stimulus Bill denied due to the amount of money going to foreign governments. Not the 2k payment. Head over to r/politics everyone doesn’t seem to realize that. And since my opinion on it doesn’t align directly with theirs and I get downvoted, I’m only allowed to post every 15 minutes so there’s no way I could respond to everyone that has actual questions on why it wouldn’t pass, and can’t look into it because it’s explicitly omitted from all their news sources

Imagine using old reddit, get with the times old man.   We use the new reddit with Jim Cramer as the wsb baby
Basically a blank check company sets up a shell company with money from institutions at $10 a share. Generally they amass $100 million to $700 million, although some are now in the billions. The SPAC finds a private entity looking to go public, comes to an agreement on valuation/equity, and then announce an agreement.   It’s essentially buying a mystery box at $10 a share and you find out in 1-10 months what’s in it. The shares are protected with a $10 trust floor, meaning that if shit hits the fan you can always redeem your shares at $10 until a merger is approved. Almost always once the target company is announced the share price goes up anywhere from $11-$30. If you buy around $10 you have almost zero risk of losing money. Biggest loss is opportunity cost of your money sitting at $10 while waiting for an announcement.

I just don’t see how this hasn’t always been a possibility to be factored into the price. To me it seems like fear mongering just causing a short term dip.
Its omitted because there's no foreign relief in the 900B stimulus bill.   You are mixing up the omnibus bill with the relief package. The omnibus bill has a ton of stuff that needs funding.

Imagine going to a United States medical school, graduating and then saying fuck residency I’m starting my own healthcare tech startup and trading stonks. Literally made more money in three days than 4 months of 120 hour week work as a resident physician. Like why would I go back to that slave ship 🚢
To add some tips to my other comment, here are some things that helped me: buy shares and stay far away from options. But you probably won't listen so if/when you do options again, don't buy weeklies and don't risk too much of your portfolio in them. Personally I try to maintain at least 90% shares, 10% or less options. And implement some other rules that force you to stop/reevaluate/learn more etc if you're losing too much (whatever that means to you).    Also margin has been really helpful but **only use it for shares, and hopefully safe/long term ones**. Going crazy with margin can kill you. It's essentially a loan for investing so be really careful

As a medical doctor I don’t recommend taking either vaccine. Just because one that shit alters your dna 🧬 and long term side effects ie 2-3 year have not been seen due to expeditious nature of the rollout. Only benefit to taking the vaccine I can see is if you are hoping for a black swan and getting super powers from altering your dna

In the US? Fuk no.  Americans wear dirty ass shoes in the house everywhere.  Carpet just takes all of the shit, puke, spit, and dirtiness you walked on outside and soaks it into the floor in your house.    At least w/ hardwood it is easy to mop.

I always get salty af seeing these huge gains. This year I’ve come so close to hitting some life changing money, but I either held too long or sold too early. Needless to say, this is going to be a bad Christmas. I know one of these days I’m gonna make it though. I genuinely hope you fellow degens have a successful 2021. Happy holidays everyone.

Either going to be a bad Christmas or a good one.*  *POSITION AMZN 3160/3165 with MAX PAIN at 3170 to 3180.*  *If AMZN close tomorrow above 3165, then I am good.*  &amp;#x200B;  Happy to report AMZN never gone near the 3165. So I am $325 in the pocket today. That's a $40/hr job right there.
well if there's a Democrat house majority, senate majority, and president that really puts the spotlight on them...pretty much whatever action they take will be solely attributed to Democrats  I expect a sudden turn around of positivity from the MSM if this happens, otherwise the focus will just be "everything would've worked out perfectly except for those darn R senators"  I think its silly to think these people aren't working together in numerous ways to enrich themselves at the taxpayer's expense, regardless of party affiliation
For what u goochlicker
got in at like 219..pretty happy about it, was gonna go like 30% cash till the new year but hard to pass that up

As long as it's a realized loss, if you haven't sold you can't consider it negative.
I did, leaps

I mean we do realize we’re in bubble territory right? I haven’t played the market long enough to see historical similarities, but I’m pretty sure it’s not normal to see everyone around you making money. I’m up $300k (389%) on the year, and i have been known to eat crayons

right, just be aware of any wash sales. if your brokerage is worth a shit you should be able to determine how much of a net loss or gain you’re at for the year via the YTD tax docs

🚨 BIG DD MOVE, DON’T READ IF YOU HATE MONEY‼️  When you get your stimmy package, use some of the proceeds to fly to the capital of Pakistan. Tell the president you’re a 🏳️‍🌈🐻, by the time you get there you’ll be the only one left. He will then hand you millions of the LGBTQ fund from the US. You will then fly back to the states and yolo it all into BABA calls. During this time, every news station in the country is going to want to hear about your brave journey. Go on Ellen and tell them how big of a 🏳️‍🌈🐻 you are. You will have millions of fans in which you can open up a charitable fund for even more tendies!
for every huge gain there are many more huge losses

To remind people like Jack Ma CCP is the boss, to show other companies they need to play by CCPs rules. China is at a pt where they are taking the lead the many fronts and this is a show of power. China needs e-commerce and fintech, BABA isn’t dead. I bought some calls today am loading up if it goes below $200.
Great advice.   I actually was not doing a lot of options, but laveraged CFDs that I paperhanded. Also usually trades after I got some good results - textbook greed to be honest.  I have 2 accounts. One for long term investments (which is doing ok. I lost tons on Wirecard, but that was special), and other for swings or daytrades. I keep the accounts separated so I'm not yoloing my long term buys.   Guess which one is the trouble kid?   I gotta get my shit together and stol daytrading and do more swings actually waiting for good accession, not forcing the recovery.   I when I lost 4k I wanted to get it back quickly and her ei am. 8k loss in 4 days

No biggest loss would be if the spac picks a shit target, or makes a poor deal. It’s lower risk, but spacs aren’t risk free.  Spacs usually have a lifespan of 2 years, if they can’t find a target shares are returned to shareholders at NAV. This may incentivize the spac to pick a company to bring public, even if that company is shit.

Ok yeah you are just really confused  There's 900B relief bill that has passed congress with a veto proof majority. Trump just needs to sign it, and if he doesnt it becomes law in 10 days. That contains the $600 as well as multiple other relief measures. It contains exactly 0 foreign aid    There's an omnibus bill of 1.4T that contains funding for tons of things, including the foreign aid people are whining about. This was passed in congress in conjunction with the 900B relief plan, making for a total 2.3T spending plan. This too is waiting a signature from trump  Finally, there's that 2k check trump wants and is why he's sitting on both the 1.4T omnibus bill and the 900B covid19 relief bill. Today, house democrats attempted to rush something through that will add it to the stimulus, but it required unanimous consent, and several republicans said no. On monday itll most likely go to a more formal vote and pass the house.

Bought a ton of different calls when it was between 213-222. Hoping we see a bit of a correction next week back to 235-240.
Didn't it already release? Heard it was trash.

The answer is basic and unappealing. The vote would be unanimous in the affirmative if politicians thought it would directly affect the GA runoff. Remember, you're only worth a vote to these people, and once you're locked in as a solid partisan your opinion is meaningless.

I can so relate. I can have an amazing trade. Close the position and instead of walking away Iwatch it every minute and see this going up/down (depending on the call/put) and... dang. Going back in! I perfectly timed the trend reversal, but not the direction.   And exactly - I then pause. Go in in a good moment. Exit. And repeat like a moron

This isn’t a political sub, and I would never claim to be an expert, but best case scenario (investment-wise) means all world governments are purchasing and using their surveillance products, among other products and purchasers, obviously. Not saying the technology is good or bad on its own, but it seems really, really hard for that to end up being a net positive for freedom, privacy, rights of the accused, law enforcement deescalation, etc.   Again, just my opinion.

Ironically the more money you have the less you can pay your taxes. That is because the IRS is severely underfunded and cannot afford people lawyering up. This was probably done in purpose for obvious reasons
I woulda thought we got up to at least 382 before end of year and then dumped but nah. Just a small dump here and there and SPY looks like a shit sandwich that teases you with its succulent buns.

Pls mvis. Fly again. I can’t be the only retard in this
A Christmas sell off? What kind of monsters do that?
What if I tell them I want blowjobs from people who aren’t qualified as payment to fudge their numbers.
ccp is scum
Do I buy ARKG leaps or is IV too high? What contracts are y’all in??
not until all of wsb has sold their positions for a loss
winni the pooh unless jack ma says he's sorry
It doesn’t have the be a bad Christmas. Money, women, stuff in general shouldn’t effect your mood. The sooner you realize that relying on external things to change the way you feel internally doesn’t work, the more free you will be.   My recommendation, if you are around others right now and have been acting/feeling pouty - tell them you’re going to change your mood and you’ll be back in a little. Go on a walk or go sit in a room alone and decide that you’re going to have a good Christmas. Stay in the room or on the walk until you can make this deal with yourself then come out. Hope you have a good Christmas dude.
Same. But for my 2 nephews
welcome back gulag gang member   the mods have engaged in civil war  the sub is ours now
Thank you for this post! If anyone needs someone to talk to im also here for you!
Fuckin rad
Ap.xt and BFT.
I sold at $56 with a nice profit and then YOLOd right at $61 on the run up
Seconded
lol u r the 1%... most actually gained a lot of weight, got fuked on the market and also losing their minds by being at home 24/7.  &amp;#x200B;  Gongrats and f u!
wtf
Completely agreed, which is why I believe the company will take off. It is a massive market and they seem to be the best at it. Still doesn’t make it a fun proposition lol
You don’t know what an ascending triangle is
what did you do to deserve the ban?
Lolololol instantly hired.
Do this after their lock up period. I’m balls deep with 10,000 stonks at 21 average price. Once price hits 33.50 I’m out. Get my 100,000 gainz and wait for the dip after lock up ends.
made a lot of money this year...  still aint got a girl tho
Why do you live with your ex-wife
What’s the next spac play ?
It'll go back up, don't worry. Don't panic sell like a simp
how do you even get banned on here? lmao
What happens to the US market if the government shuts down next Monday?
no stimulus until 1/21 it seems
What’s everyone’s opinion on sbux? Does it have a lot of room to grow still? I always feel weird about food companies because like how much growth could they possibly have planned compared to tech

mods pleas fly again
BFT gonna print
I guess if you have jerked off to one, you have jerked off to them all.
Of course I don’t, what sub do you think we’re posting on.
Just became eligible for my company’s 401K. Best performing (and highest risk) index I am allowed to select is up 16% on the year.  I did 16% today on my own
Don’t tell them anything. They’ll ruin those too.
Hey bby 😘
Is spy gonna finally break out this next week?
How do I earn that hard earned vacation sir ?
$50k PLTR/$50k NIO Shares here.

What the hell is wrong with you 😂
Bought a few calls today since everyone keeps saying that.

B-but Cramer said we're an unstoppable force!
K keep holding. I’ll keep downloading games directly to my Xbox like everyone else on earth.
i bought it today..
Seriously these fucking retards with FDs getting mad at a stock
Had to sell half my PLTR yesterday. Creeping up to slow. Put that into X L Fleet and killed it :)
No I’m still in it pretty heavy along with a lot other seemingly smart people at r/MVIS
Why didn’t u ask her for a sniff?

Thanks man
Next week I'll get good and drunk Monday AM and just yolo 1k into some sort of ridiculous FD
Lol
ICLN gonna start its moon mission as we get closer to January and Biden’s inauguration

lol plenty of retards... fomo is one hell of a drug
I miss the days where posting that ticker would get you banned. It feels like Im in a crossover episode between wsb and r/pennystocks
😂 China bots
Good shit
I miss staring at lines and numbers 😑
How thick are we talking? Pics
A lot of people on socials are showing off their COVID vaccine card for internet cool points. I noticed Pfizer listed as the company, free advertising! Pfizer to the moon next week (30 cents)!
Buy one
They also said that at 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24. I'm seeing a trend here
Markets closed tomorrow
same for me. feels kinda wrong doing so well when so many are suffering. hope next year is better for everyone
😂 China bots in this thread
Bet you can also do -100% on your own in a day too.
wire me your cash and ill do it for you!
Fucking patience bro.
How have you met more people this year than on average lol
I'm starting a secret Santa futures trading group.  Load up on shorts if you think you got socks but maybe it's a PS5.  Open through Christmas. Fuck em pussy boys at NYSE that need time off to see family.
psych reads were dead on
Fuck yeah dude I always hedge my bigger positions with $SPY too. It’s fucked me a few times on weird stock specific news but very rarely do my picks drops without the rest of the market going with it.
well that escalated quickly.   Try the dark web.
THB.R
you can have mine, i want a new one
When is lockup ?
Apply for a fire depo position in a small quite town. You will have plenty of free time to you lurk on WSB and lose money oh RH while doing pull ups and push ups in the engine bay.
Be careful of expense ratios on 401K funds. They had me in some 2% fund that tracks domestic and international bonds. Lmao switched that to Vanguard 500, been smooth sailing since.
The older I’ve gotten, the less I’ve cared about women’s looks
Imagine having mods
French foreign legion will give you a new identity but you have to work somewhere in Afrikka
Imagine thinking stimulus is going to ever happen. Silly poors.
Icln gang, standing by
Only the Godless heathen countries
Lazy Yankees always taking days off
When will options be available ?
So, wait for another dip and buy?
But was it tax free?
Why do you think that we're gonna bust through to $33 before the lockup?
Yeah I’ve done -70% before in a day, lol. But that was when I had only $4000 in my portfolio and did all in on Tesla for battery day. Lol.
Already has
The first step to losing money is watching futures
If it's not them it'd be someone else. I don't like it either but the data mining has been going on for the last decade plus. Google and FB know more about you than your parents do. RH sells your order flows.   I'm just here to make money so I'm not getting fucked as hard by the man.
Pay some taxes at least
Ban this dumb fuck
☝
I'm in N G A right now and expect it to fly once it merges with Lion Electric and changes the ticker to LEV. I'm in T H C 🐝 since $11 and still holding. Made a killing on P I C (now X L)
Monday  Is we pumping or is we pumping
Shit you right, your personal habits are indicative of the entire market! All the people camping in front of GME on Black Fridayand inside of the store for the last month must have actually been hallucinations. I really need to stop doing acid while I do DD

"allegedly" penny shilling
I use my 401k as protection from me red dildoing my ass from time to time.
I bought feb calls also today.  Good luck!
stone island turtleneck, and nkla drilled like bp wishes they could
Wut
So high risk reward for bottoms haha
We use Vanguard too, I have yet to figure out how to switch to indexes that are outside my company’s plan. Never used vanguard before
It's not tho.. The company is showing green numbers, covid had turned the world to work differently. PCs in the households are increasing, number of people streaming is more than ever, nber of gamers are constantly increasing.  Corsair is definitely not undervalued for its potential market cap. And they make some of the best products out there, a lot better than Razr and are Logitech.  The price has dipped, but it will continue to rise long term, the company is most likely the best in its franchise and had a lot of room to grow.
Just shat and wiped and it was completely clean. Not like 99% clean, 100% fucking clean
bullish, the "govt" is half the problem.
You don't want a girl that's with you for the money so that's good.
And the fundamentals haven’t changed that whole time. This company is obsolete and will be out of business soon. WSB coordinating a pump and dump doesn’t change that.
hi
Those numbers make me sick. I know I have no reason to feel like I missed out but I do. Took a lot of restraint to not fomo buy a put or two this morning
My brother is homeless for Christmas for the first time ever, feels weird man
Been there. Fuck prime day 2019
"allegedly" penny shilling...made the mistake of posting something without a trillion dollar market cap...
If you win, I win brother
Boomers really are retarded for putting their accounts in this shit
Congrats
Man. Theta going to be eating my nio and pltr calls all long ass weekend.
Sounds like cancer
Merry Christmas you cockslurpers.  You helped me make so much money this year, I'm not even kidding.  Except I passed on GME.  Fuck you.  Maybe next year.
7c 1/15 at 1.15 here. I think we’re in good shape but I’m a fucking idiot so who knows
Their most recent ER confirms what I said
After this years market gains, those dips would get bought up so fast.
Europe will moon the market next week.  Brexit news n shit.
alexa play hammer smashed face
Oh boy the people who think they caught the bottom on BABA are going to have a real bad time Monday. 🇨🇳🤡
Merry X-mas you retards thanks for helping a new (+newly unemployed-fuk you CA) dad make some money. My first purchase was PLTR + ASAN on the direct offering -we're up 21k since
Damn Ive ripped off in the past guess i have to do more research before buying
Go back and tell her you work at Wendy's, so she knows you have stuff in common and gives you a shot.
Idc what the price tag is, no one looks good in a turtleneck. And congrats on the nkla gains!
Ah yes, classic buy the news
been doing that a lot lately. i like to believe its evolution.

Sold my NIO calls because the break even price was ridiculous

Anyone still locking gains or tax loss harvesting will be finishing up Monday and Tuesday so their trades can settle within the 2020 tax year. There is also the potential for more stimulus/budget vote shenanigans so you might not be totally hosed.
Infinity DTE shares.  I trust Cathie enough not to gamble on her lol
I have 6c for that date and I’m not worried. Was up over 100% the day I bought it but fucking day trade restricted. If you read some of their threads it’ll definitely make you feel better about it for now but come Monday we’ll have a better idea
Think about it like this bro “I could have anyone of them but I’m in no rush.”
Guh fubo
Just hoping we get back to ATH of 33.50 sometime in the next 4 weeks. If that happens, I’m out and exit with $100,000 gainz. I’m long term bullish but pretty sure there is gonna be a dump of shares, once lock up expires. Not interested in bag holding.
Time for the AMZN coil to unwind 👀
I believe you are rational about this one.
🏳️‍🌈🐻
side effect from your butt plug
Options on BABA were weird today. The stock went up 7 points from 11:30 and calls kept dropping
They are 🤡
"My company"
Im burning through jobs as well, i miss the people but the companies i was with were for a quick check anyways, basically prostitution.
Tax free, 3.5% max match and when you put in 6%
Did I fuck up buying the baba dip?
What’s a good entry for fubo? feel like this thing will be triple digits I’m the future.
baba going to 100s soon :S
I like this idea
Another 10-15% sounds likely
If you didn’t convert your calls into shares over a long weekend then you ain’t even black
BABA is nothing like Luckin’s accounting scandal. Big nothing burger for BABA will jump 5-10% on Monday. I bought my kid a Winnie Pooh Toy to celebrate it.
Vanguard is a wonderful company. Look up what the founder did for us average shmucks. I have my entire Roth and 401K with them.
Read: the company I work for
Well, I’m no expert on the matter. Maybe. Maybe not.
What’s the Monday moves !
Theragrippers
Even more bad news?
What’s GME doing Monday ?
From one degenerate to another, well done.  Cheers to many more gains.
Isn’t that already applied at close?
Ban
Then Brexit happening the week after will dip the market back to Earth.
This is a stay at home stock that has benefited from covid and guess what? Covid is coming to an end. You still holding Home Depot too?
lol :( baba going to get yeeted to like 100s soon, May buy if they declare bankrupcy for the rocket
NVDA boys I know you saw the dark pool volume last few days. Today was the perfect dip to buy for March and June. February earnings. Textbook consolidation for a month. The boys upstairs been loading up. Big bets placed on news coming soon.
Good on you. I went autist and bought 12/31’s
CHINESE COMPANIES CAN ALL GO FUCK THEMSELFS AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED.
When I hear that the strength of the dollar is projected to drop by 15% in the next two years, that makes me a lot less impressed about a 30% gain. Things are going to get a lot more expensive.
which ark did cathie put baba in?
All in baba. U guys autistic if u think China will destroy its poster child. Ma gonna hit up mr Pooh, bow and apologize &amp; this shit gonna moon  $BABA 🚀🚀🚀🚀
Just feel safer switching to selling AMZN puts, until after PLTR lock up over.
What are your calls for next week??
reading ppl and the market is the same shit. just change details.
I‘d skip Christmas if the markets were open Friday to Sunday
Jus do u and make more $
# 2000 dollar checks pleas fly again
Feeling like throwing 10k in options gimme suggestions brahs
No idea. I’m hoping for 50% profit early Monday and get out. My luck it will go down 50%
caught the falling knife baba at $218. sliced right thru my hand and then hit the floor and bounced back right up thru my hand
Yes
Stupid ass question, do mutual funds have reduced hours today too? The ones I have haven’t updated yet and I feel they should by now

I got furloughed but have more money than ive ever had due to the government shoveling that extra $600 and investing in a market starting at rock bottom in march.  My future is completely fucked but im sitting on a pile of cash like the Joker in Dark Knight.

So madagascar?
Why am I so attracted to finance cougars like Christine Lagarde, Cathie Wood, etc..
I think its a good play... the 1/28 earnings call covers Prime Day, Black Friday/Cyber Monday, and Christmas.

Work out a bunch and don't jerk off for a month, you will have basement level standards
Elon to team up with Supreme. ELON will sell paper shares with the supreme logo on it for 20k
only a small position, it’s more of a gamble
AAPL
How about $30C by jan 15
Would be a nearly half trillion dollar company. Would clearly have a major impact and would probably take down other china stonks
So they decided to drop all the good news after close
Word I’m balls deep already :p
How long do you guys typically hold your calls?
A call that’s like a year out or more
yea no shit. i was just having a giggle m8. cant have shit in wsb
i bought it, only a small position tho, it’s more of a gamble
That is my position sir
I literally got cucked trying to roll a short put because the market closed after I bought back and before I could resell. Did not realize it closed at 1 today. I truly belong here.
U buy on the face ripping day?
Buy otm calls for $4000 checks. imagine the return

Too much political and fraud risk investing in Chinese companies. Stock to the developed world where this is more certainty
like what?
That only happens if people have money sitting in cash waiting to buy. This market is so insanely bullish and greedy right now nobody has any cash left and even if they did why put it into a covid bubble stock when covid is almost over?

I wonder how many people in here are not mid 20s white American males...  Just now realizing there’s probably a little more diversity than that here but I just assume that who I’m talking to each time
So do it. Don't think about it, just do it, as long as you make a sixty bucks or so a day online you can easily do it
Y?
How is the market green but are pretty much all my positions red.   I must be retarted
PLTR doesn’t have much revenue and their total addressable market is small
I’ve never done a leap tbh, just a couple few months out calls on AAPL and ICLN so far but feel like ARKG should be easy money as well. How do you hedge your leaps? Buying a put as well?
Curious what BABA will do in HK

If you don’t work at Wendy’s, I strongly urge everyone to look at your companies 401K plans. I forgot the exact number but 70% of Americans don’t know wtf is being taken out of their paychecks every two weeks. Investment companies will milk the shit out of you.

What need is that?
ARKF has it I’m pretty sure
It's either going to be a $10B company or a $10M penny stock
What do you think that says about you?
10% luck  20% will  15% power of shill   It’s 30% deep fucking value    25% weeklies   And 100% reason to remember the GME

Lmao well we deserve to be rewarded for finding the stocks that blow up. I honestly think the market is supposed to be like this, tho. It just took forever to get commission free trading and make it available to everyone, ease of access to information through the internet etc. Only downside is when we drop we're gonna drop hard as fuck
So should I just say fuck the calls in my personal brokerage and load up on shares in my roth ultra long term?
Is scanning for a stock that has an ema9 crossing under the ema200 a for sure profit? It seems that all the stocks ive looked at with this characteristic recover over the ema200 eventually
a quick 1 second google search shows Palantir has a little more revenue than NIO. but then again this is wsb so my expectations werent too high to begin with
You think this can open 240 Monday?

Upvote if you’ve been a good little bull this year and believe in Santa and his rally. Downvote if you’re a gay little bear and you love shoving coal up your prison stocking
This is correct 😂 I can’t pull it off
FUBO PUTS
$SIMP
with those kinds of gains maybe you should reevaluate :)
let me know when belle delphine drops her porn
That's what being shorted into oblivion looks like lmao
it’ll recover
Damn, he is sexy af tho
its not that hard, ordinarily
There’s a bull case for GME but this ain’t it
I thought this was well understood to the extent he needs shit tons of cash to get there in the first place
Sorry just being a dick . I hear ya
3 strikes.
Btfd baby
Bought in on yesterday, averaged down today at the low. So 8C at 1.07 isn’t terrible  got about 42 of em lol
That's literally why we pump money into him.

Isn’t Nancy famous for insider trading with Visa IPO? She’s one of us.
You only like her because she looks like a 13 year old
After “catching the bottom” over and over for the last month I finally leaned my lesson and dumped this chink scam and holy lord did it feel good. RIP to all the BABA bag holders out there you will never financially recover from this one.
Nothing is for sure, but various indicators and TA can help give better chances at a profit
It’s already mooning lol. I’m up 20% on boomer ass shares since November
Ya but burned more than thrice? I think not
Fuck the stupid ass mods.
Yeah but they said that last year too
So is it like giving money to charity?
chinese companies can all go fuck themselves so far as I'm concerned.

Pleas fly again AMZN 🥺
anybody else check their account at the end of the day and be like WHAT THE FUCK did i buy all this absolute shit for, and then ponder over whether to sell it and be like WHAT IF THIS SHIT SHOOTS UP, and get stuck holding all these spacs and wierd calls and be like FUCK THIS BETTER GO UP
I will be next year 😃
Rip

Don’t sweat it there’s a new pump and dump every month
Just won’t stop dropping. Next week should be interesting. I bought some 1/15 puts earlier today.
Dont get in, its been fucking holders since six damn months
Agreed. Elon is a visionary, money is just the means.
Day 13 is Monday! It’s going parabolic Monday!
girls are alowed to stonk?
It’s gonna be not good
Bro baba is the only one in hot water right now the others will print. Baba will print too over time this dip is a blessing and a curse
No I sell options so I actually make money
nancy is quite dirty, she will sell her child for the right price
10/10 would hug
If they’re SPACs ur prolly good homie.
BABA and FUBO gonna be such a shit show on Monday. PUTS YA FOOSSSSS
Give this guy the Anal God flair
Dude it went from 1K to 3K in a few months what do you mean please fly again. 😂
Then rinse and repeat, absolutely
Exponential to infinity
I really have no idea, what's the strike?

Don’t europoors take like 2 months of vacation every year?
The biggest
They just gonna reload for a magnificent flight
I’ll look more into it. I know of it. I think that’s what I’ve been doing the whole time but I’m retarded. From what I see from my short time here is that as long as you’re not making crazy weekly otm calls you make gains in meme stocks. As long as they’re at least like 6 weeks out. That’s what I’ve been doing.... and it’s working 🚀
so your gonna wait for everything to run up and let all of us make profits, and then when it bursts 6 months - 1 year later you're gonna hope it makes another run? why not just get in now lol
The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) increased 9.4% to close at 14.82.   lmao

You do realise that's one of the most common indicators right?
Who's doing festivus this year?
Market hates easy money, will crush any option holders that bought the dip
Gonna be so funny when then CCP commies it up and nationalizes BABA.
Thanks! And anyone down voting does not know how to celebrate tendies.
And? Who would rather see their brother homeless on the streets than give him a couch because of the risk that he will overstay his welcome. That's some messed up family values
You joking? Or you’re expecting it to spike?
Currently sitting on 7 different SPACS with 1K in warrants of each. Just hold them. Literally will make you money if you are anywhere near NAV.
I step away from the market for a day and you all sink it? Cmon fellas
Put that toilet paper right back on the roll!
its a trap!
NIO has no reason to fall only good news incoming and they are directly controlled by the CCP. Baba is gunna be ok in the long run the company has more potential than Amazon, people are just so fucking dramatic and forget fundamentals
Amzn
Potential growth compensates for the risk. This is BABA not done bullshir stock. If u want 100% safe stick to a savings acct or s&amp;p
Did zeejayzee leaving break the automod? Where’s the new thread :(

i think nio is a good bet if you give yourself more time, jan might be a roller coaster with the senate race, stuff might go nuts upward or downward, dudes will shift their portfolios and NIO might be a huge beneficiary or the other way around. im gambling a lot but its mostly with my profits, i still got some loser AAPL Square Paypal GM blah blah leaps
If you’re feeling down about your plays, just think about all the people hoarding Xboxs and PS5s in their garages about to be the ultimate bag holders.    Makes me smile everytime I’m down knowing there’s someone out there about to be absolutely fucked with all the consoles they’ve got in their garages trying to scalp them for the holidays
Same haha, that’s why i like to see what other people think as well. I mean i think good news and a request for more trucks could make it take off again. It’s much lower than it’s $50+ high a month ago.   I got 6 HYLN 4/16 25s. Didn’t want to go too far OTM
Like?
no idea
You don't think the way people operate on daily bases has changed? You don't think companies that used to spend thousands of dollars on employes traveling for meetings will change company policy? Do you think streaming will suddenly decrease when Covid is gone?   I don't own Home Depot, but if you cannot understand that covid has changed a lot in our societies than you are a fool. And FYI, Covid will be a part of our lives for a minimum of two more years.. we won't be going back to our offices until 2022.
He turned it off. We flying solo
Just tell them you can't.
To all the loud BABA bears today. I dont wanna hear no bitching next month when everyone is posting gain pornos
He was responsible for actively moderating the place with all of his auto mods and whatnot. Without him none of the other mods do jack shit and this place is essentially a floating, rudderless derelict.
Anyone wanna chain donate and match? $20. Call it white elephant charity.  Obviously to a charity.
I dont think so. He left before this daily thread came up so idk what the fuck is going on

What happened to chimpu
Baba actually makes money
Not gonna stop me from watching it
im looking at it now. ive got 18 shares that cost about same as atm call jan 21 22. that sounds like 5 to 1 to me. add a put for the same price would make it 2.5 to 1 leverage. knowing greeks would be helpful, delta, gamma theta

Gonna be a long 3 days until Monday market opens again. Hope we make some money.
The Suze Orman Show is proof poor people don’t know how to handle money. They got ladies who make $12,000 a year calling in to ask if they can afford a brand new Mercedes-Benz.

Agreed though for SPACS with targets - it’s a pretty bulletproof call variant with minimal time premium

I'm a white American male in my thirties. Suck it.
I backtest strategies similar to yours and have a program that scans the market for tickers that meet my technical requirements for entry each day.  I would suggest adding an RSI component to your requirements.  Bear in mind that as the market changes, these strategies need tweaking. It’s a bit more complicated than you assume, but not by much.   Don’t be a bitch and use a strategy like this to buy stock. Calls only, mf. If you want to minimize risk then do diagonals.
The second company I was with legit have a mass exodus of all of its lower level employees, luckily I was the first one because I heard shit got right there when management caught on
You know how when you cum inside a woman some of your seman infect her brain and make her smarter? Which man did this to cathie wood? I want to follow his moves in stocks
to retards with FD calls, -0.7% in a day is a world ender
Probably, but at that price why not just buy shares?
Every time it drops a couple dollars tho, it fuckin slingshots back up. Just the Ark way.
I dunno I don’t know Chinese
those SPACs could go down following their respective mergers so that risk is still there. For those without targets, the risk of direct listing very much threatens them.
Im so fucking jealous of people who started trading in march/april. Literally free money no matter what you bought
Mods ded ANARCHY

Last 2 weeks of the year is usually good for some easy gains.

Come on bro! Always something to celebrate, if you lost tendies, u learned not to lose them for 2021!
God forbid we ‘overheat’ our economy
what
Eh half joking at this point
Most sold too early, and are now regretting it. In other words, still retarded.
No one believed it would go up. That’s what made it difficult
I am a charity
Its all fun and games until tokopedia decides to go with a direct listing or IPO and BTWN has to find another target
Is my  BA 6/15 $500c gonna make it
Can it? Sure... I bought FD’s to scalp. It went from A low of 212 to 222. Could see 230-235 at open.
Didn't it leak? Literally saw it on my Twitter feed this morning.

Merry Xmas to all of you retards and autists 🎄
I never said NIO had a lot of revenue did I? They have similar revenue but the TAM for NIO is exponentially larger than Palantir. There is no chance PLTR can maintain their current growth rate whereas NIO will likely continue to accelerate.

Shut up bitch
Id say 1/5 of wsb got wiped out by baba today
It never was
I was sitting on some cash at the time but I had to stay completely liquid because I had some legal fees and needed to purchase a vehicle and insure it and such.... It was unfortunate that I had to sit it out but at least I was holding 100 shares of NET the whole time.

I think you'll be good. I'm holding 110 shares so I'll be rooting for a ripper soon.
Mean reversion strategy, well done. That was pioneered in the early 80s! Renaissance trading.

Yeah thats why im all in.
Just think they have jobs (the ppl who thought of this) while alot of good people remain out in the cold.
I sold all my solar stocks at their max yesterday...I REALLY would like to get back in, but it seems hard as hell to get them on a dip these days (unless the companies are based in China, i.e. JKS, DQ).
Certainly a point of discussion: wsb.gold
lost 40k today.  Whoooo BABA
More
On calls that expired. I'm making money on SRNE though.
Looking to buy calls for mid January to Feb. What's the 🚀🚀🚀🚀 that will take me to the moon?
Likewise asshole! Now go fuck yourself!
Yeah I’ve never really dropped much cash on options so haven’t really thought about hedging but I guess it makes sense since leaps are expensive so lot to lose if it goes sideways. I’ll probably either do that or just buy shares
Are you literally retarded?
I’m in it but just shares because I’m a wallstreet bitch.  I’ll join you on the moon
I wonder if anyone had 1/2 of their portfolio in BABA. Sad. Not supposed to happen to a huge successful company.
Monthlies are the way if you are going to do anything. Obviously the gains for weeklies can be insane but so can losses. Leaps are dope too. Gives you ease of mind which is actually nice
PLTR
Melvin, Melvin, Melvin... When will you learn? You're playing against literal retards here
I learned more about you in this exchange than u/247drip   Fucking retard
Smart man
Yeah waiting for jan to rebalance and add more calls and shares. Dont want to realize any more gains before 2021. January is gonna be a good month for us retards. I can feel it in my left nut
More than 50% gains just in tech etfs.
Mt
NIO, I’d say BABA if you go a little longer
Streaming is recurring subscription revenue bro. That is far far different than retail hardware sales. Cope all you want but this thing is at the top. Best case scenario from here is a slow grind upward but lagging the overall market.
Not a bad idea🤔
I'm riding the ICLN train, taking profits a few times a month and rolling them out about once a month. What a time
Do you think it’s still a good time to buy ?

U don’t know how to fuck either

What the fuck happened today??
14d, 6w, 1q or 8-10 months for leaps  gonna see how long I can hold onto these aapl $130 Jan 23 leaps
I feel like baba isn’t a popular stock for ppl here, aside from those who tried to catch the knife. Before it fell in November, didn’t hear much about it. It took me for 10 percent of my portfolio today though smh
Green
BABA situation is why I never fuck with chinese stonks. If you make the commies mad you’re toast.
Nah, on put spreads
Hot dog is a sandwich
Ban
Oh nio, the day of hitting $50 is never gonna happen. Fuck me
it’s an over reaction. must be rebounding next week. 🤞🏻
lol BABA is nothing compared to the CCP - they could nationalize this company tomorrow or transfer 100% ownership to Winnie the Pooh and you would just have to take it up the ass
Christine lagarde? Really? You need help. Bro.
Hard not to buy a dip like that! Why would China want to handicap their biggest online marketplace? imo it’s more of a show of who’s the boss
No way lol
Serious question. Why do y’all do options ? Like compared to just buying regular stocks. Or even spreads which are a lot more likely to make money. I feel like half the time people lose money and a lot of it when playing naked calls or doing puts.
[removed]
Market was up today?
Nio’s big run is over

Thank Jesus you bought enough time to expiry. Wait for IV to crush (already did mostly) and average down some, sell the original ones when it bounces

Luxury family cars are just Honda’s with better leather quality change my mind

Well yeah but that's fundemantelly wrong because the Dotcom bubble really was a bubble and the tech bubble is just disruptive technology getting evaluated.
I should be excited for tomorrow because it’s Christmas, but instead I’m a sad little retard because I can’t gamble all of my money away😢

1st big run\*\*\*
True but that really is fuckin dick move on managements part.
Nio is just a leech growing on Tesla. I wouldn't trust it
You can magnify your wins/losses with less capital it would require to just invest/trade on the stock alone.  Also, you can accelerate your wins/losses at a time frame of your choosing.
A 31 day ban? Who bans someone for 31 days? Atleast pick 30 or 35

so about 2-3 weeks ago? cus same
Gainzzzzz bros
I mean, I’ve seen tons of posts on here alone with $500k+ gains. You think those people are leaving after that?
Why would you ever want that as a highschooler.
pleas fly
G H I V taking off but still plenty of time to get in before we hit 20
NIO and PLTR are done for
You’re completely right but that’s the point I think. Lexus is just fancy Toyota, Acura just fancy Honda
Just read CRSR’s outlook update from November end and it kinda made my PP hard  Glad I bought more on the dip today fuck everyone who is selling
Lmao.. you ever been in a Benz you poor bastard!
Ban again
Think of it this way. Lets say you got $50,000 in Amazon. But hey, you know this shits going up over the next year. Buy call leaps 6-8 months out, and for the same move you would have made 2-4x more with the options than just holding the underlying. Obviously this is an example, sometimes you buy calls too far out it may not move as much, etc etc, but you get the point.
buttcunt?
Baby 4-digit portfolio here.   I have 100 GME shares. Should I buy 25c Jan29 and sell 25c Jan15 to offset the premium cost?
I replied to some guy telling him his ticker was a penny stock and probably will get banned for shilling and all because I added the ticker to my comment I was banned...
This guy again
yeah i get that but i mean when people buy weeklies with deep OTM
It’s coming next week 🚀
I just got a car wash and it started raining. Calls on my local car wash

bro, I get it, I have ICLN calls too, but stop the pump I see on your profile, I need to buy more calls then you can resume
Hey at least you can sleep well knowing some dude is going to be up at least 10%
Good
But does CRSR have a 10x potential in 5 years?
I flipped it for $400 profit after that big earnings drop. Way too much bad history here for me to take a long term position. I feel there's better opportunity elsewhere.
Baba has jerked me around a few times, so I don’t really mind seeing gyna flex on jack for a minutes.  Baba looking like a snack rn but I don’t have a good grip on how CCP antitrust cases go...not like here in US  Tell you what, this might create a new bull case for JD...

Pretty sure the safe bet is leaps on blue chip tech winners you are confident about.  Shares with margin for everything else.  For me its 50/50, sometimes I worry that I am not diversified enough.  Then I come to WSB and my approach seems very responsible.

Pltr down 3%, time to sell 🤡🤡🤡
Jack Ma really got an amazing Christmas president from the CCP
They did talk a little bit about how it’s unknown if growth will slowdown in the post covid world, but they also pointed out how untapped their total market is in terms of new customers so who is to say  Personally bull on gaming and esports in the future in general and CRSR seems like a company that can manage financial metrics well (so far) so that’s also a plus
Yes
Wait were you also the one who sold all those LULU condors last week and made a lot? Theta gang is great until the steamroller comes. But I guess if you can survive you'll make it back.

Ok so I am wondering about how many of you retards here believe that *TSLA is a bubble*.  Upvote: no    Downvote: yes.
For real. A personal letter from Santa saying it would be in your best interest to not leave the country 😂
I gots Beamer last year. I was surprised by how they jip you on features and such
88 hrs 7 mins until market Open
Free money as long as you don’t hold a 1400% gain through a merger like I did with DM 🤦‍♂️
I just feel like anyone over 12 could figure out the market opens at 9:30 on Monday
pussy
Pls
I have had enough excitement for the year.  I was down 70% now down 40% and crawling back from a chain of sir this is a casino decisions.
Maybe, we'll see. If it was 42-43, I'd say it's the top. I strongly believe they will crush earnings tho and go past ATH after earnings.
True
I bought a cheap option at close on gme and then sold in the morning. Someone held those bags when they expired today
GME pls fly again 🚀
My puts say otherwise
Don’t do it you’ll only lose money that you could instead lose in the stock market
No frens or family holiday discussion thread
It’s both a bubble and not
They’ve been manipulating their oil company stocks for decades, you could be on to something.
I’ve built up about 400k in semi leaps and a little more than half are NVDA. Rest AMD and TSM  This is gonna be an amazing year for the sector and I’m gonna squeeze every last buck out of it.
why diversify when you can just pick the stock thats gonna go up the most

To bubble or not to bubble. This is fucking deep
a bubble within a bubble
Would u rather suffer for 10 years and at the end have a 75% chance winning $100 mil, or be satisfied rn with above average income?
Yes my approach would seem risky by normal standards.  But here? Might as well call me a boomer and get it over already.
PLTR dips are a gift from God
Everybody knows it’s a bubble. The question is whether or not people *care* it’s a bubble. Then you’d get a lot more upvotes.
I’m a tard, what’s DA? Direct assignment right?
Test
Yup, the one day
I mean obviously
Lul
Exactly lol
&gt; happy Christmas  You belong here
Happy Christmas sounds gay
I chose the mid/small cap fund over the target date fund and so far it has returned like 58% YTD. Pretty sure the target date fund did a lot worse. Make sure thoroughly go through all your choices.
How bad is the suffering?
Yes. This I agree with. I still think the risk is small. Ma gonna have to do some dick sucking for my tendies, but I think it’s inevitable.
This is better

Next time on To Catch A Falling Knife, I join fellow BABA bag holders in debating whether to buy the Monday dip. Or the Tuesday dip. Or the Wednesday dip... How low can it go, right? Right?! Sincerely wishing I had bought BIDU by accident...
That’s a crazy gamble. I can’t even imagine how fuckin pissed I’d be if I hit the 25%. No thanks. I’ll take mediocrity.
And we all think we’re the next Warren Buffet while we’re actually Nick Leeson 😂
If it’s light suffering I’m into it
Just hop on grinder bro
Fellow degens. Should I take Wisconsin ML or Michigan State?   Sportsbooks have Wisconsin as the favorite. ESPN matchup prediction has Mich state wining by 50.2 percent. ESPN matchup predictor sucks tho.   Who would you guys take?

Market so flat today I threw $10 at $BABA just to feel something with the baba gangs
[removed]
Also, they position themselves as a developed country w baba, which is important for the regime. Nationalizing it will hurt their image, and w a new President coming in, I’m not sure they’d wanna do that. &amp; possible China trade deal w Biden
Haha I’m waiting outside in the rain for some ribs they clearly overbooked what they could handle. Lucky for me, my Benz is 20 years old and a piece of fucking shit. Just needs to last me until my Cybertruck is ready.
Went to Canada to see my then girlfriend around Christmas time 2 years ago.   Happiest time ever
BABA isnt going anywhere, CCP wants as much foreign money as possible to invest in Chinese companies, this would set a terrible precedent
Need to start making donations to the Human Fund for all you autists that lost money this year.
Stalking stage
Definitive agreement
are we Seriosuly going to view cathie by her gender now. She's a talented investor, period.
Its bullshit that they can trade at times we cant. They get a huge advantage and can make moves off good/bad news when the rest of us cant
Its fine
Great point to begin a scale in but hold off on going balls deep rn...it’s going to be downside sensitive for a little while   CCP antitrust might not be like US antitrust. All antitrust is just politics and as a market we have far less insight and predictability in CCP.
Star Peak energy transition looks like a real solid value play

Aight who’s holding $AAPL 12/31 calls for next week with me 👇👇
Ok so weekend shit posting starting early?  Merry Christmas retards
Saw this DD post on stocktwits [https://stocktwits.com/YOLOYOLOYOLO/message/267214058](https://stocktwits.com/YOLOYOLOYOLO/message/267214058). I personally believe the statement on MMs manipulating the stock a little to keep it flat. It has been unusually flat for a stock in such sector with a lot of attention
No
This is why I got $50k in shares and $5k in options
Oh yeah idk why anyone buys that shit.   Some peeps just want to spend money to flex I guess
No one here thinks they’re the next Warren Buffett, more like the next Michael Burry timing the top
Luxury cars are robbing you of liquidity that you could gamble in the stock market.
Just a few ropes and clamps and we are set
no it's a script that constantly displays the current odds against our latest options
Can someone please explain  on how you find a merger with SPACs? Like where do you find that info, on Bloom or just online? Plus how do you time on when to buy? Thanks in advance...
What’s the best plan for the weekend? I want to prepare for Monday but don’t know what to do.
Real question is can Melvin capital force GME any lower on Monday non organically? Barely any shares left to short and already bought ton of outs that are now out of the money, and BABA has tanked for them putting them further under water
It's a rocket ship, with a cracked heat shield, it's fine while it's traveling in space but any bad news and that baby is going to blow.
Anyone having positions in xpeng ? Shit dropped too much today
32 more minutes
Ahhh yeah happens. Its your tuition payment. Do some leaps on cloud and tech stonks you believe in. Make it 1-1 and own shares. Stairs up aint half bad either. Beats the elevator down

If you never had to pay income tax again, would it reduce your drive to make more money?

Was up 35% on my BABA calls last week. Now I’m down 80% 🤡🤡🤡
3250  Not really an FD but still out of the money enough for Theta to get it quickly.
buy a katana  study the blade
It’s hard to imagine while we’re in a raging bull market but eventually this bubble will pop and when it does those tickers will fall the hardest. Everyone knows these valuations make no sense. Every retard on this sub with a 2 week old robinhood account is making money fomoing into meme companies that have never earned a dime of profit and probably never will. You really think that is sustainable? It could be in 3 months it could be in 12 months but a crash is coming and when it does people like you will hold all the way down.
And she’s hot, of course we’re gonna view her by her gender when 90% of this sub wants to fuck her. That she’s a talented investor is a plus
Your flair intrigues me
But GME went up TWO CENTS
Sounds about right.
Wait next week is also a short week? What the fuck open the fucking markets😡
what's money
Where is Jack Ma located? Maybe Xi will send some folks to "talk to him."

You know how you guys missed the March dip and regret it? Well there's another dip in BABA that'll rebound like the March dip did for the entire market. You don't wanna miss this when it's right in front of you.
Sorry bout it baba bro

Friendly reminder for you addicts itching for a fix: you can still buy crypt🅾️
Usually slice it up in 1/2 inch pieces on a steel pan, cut some of the fat off to get a coating. It renders insanely fast. Cook about 30 sec or so each side whatever gets a nice sear. Salt and pepper. Its really rich which is why I've held off cooking it, on a 12oz steak, I can eat maybe 4oz before feeling full.
How is this news to anyone
Limit carbs. Drink water. Go to bed early. No alcohol. Plenty of greens. Get your heart rate above 180 for 30mins each day. Achieve the #1 spot for the week in DuoLingo.

I've had this exact same sentiment. My feeling is once these moratoriums expire, it's going to cause a massive snowball effect specifically in the housing market.   Interest rates are low due to big money moving to bonds and out of the market due to uncertainty. When evictions start up again (due to record unemployment and eviction notices, and americans are so far behind on rent) then homeowners will take advantage of the current high prices and evict and sell the first chance they get. But I'm assuming nobody will be buying, leading to market flood and house prices dropping.   When house prices start falling, all of a sudden people are upside down on these inflated homes they bought because the mortgage rates are so low right now.   I'm a doomsayer sure, but I see NO other outcome than a housing collapse right now.   But I'm also retarded, so.
To be fair most wouldn't care not remember it but I'm sure it would help out a few people. Those that want to show off will always be in debt up to their eyeballs.

Was buying the dip on FUBO shares around $42 since it has good support around $40 but wasn't clear on why it was dropping off a cliff.      Now I know: https://twitter.com/RichLightShed/status/1342117742212734978      This idiot has a $8 price target. He is also the same one who gave a Sell rating for Disney when it was $85 earlier this year. Seems like this dumbass with a punchable face does not understand streaming nor sports betting. Imagine you are watching a game and you are betting in the app itself as the game is streaming. Roku + DKNG!

Yeah good-luck buying a shell comoany in the cayman islands. That’s what BABA stock is, google it. Isn’t even the actual Alibaba.

Question, you dabble in spreads at all? Specifically call debit spreads. I’ve done lot of research on it and have concluded this is the better route to go. While your profit is capped, Ive heard your chance to make money is like 90%. I think next week i’m going to open some up. What you think of them?

Depends on if I'm broke or not.  I've done it in the past for similar money.   Much more financially stable now so not anytime recently.
Were the mods all eradicated again?
lmao you keep pictures of me calling you out, nice  glad to know I got you shook  rest my case
You saw that perfect pin right under 132 too. They’re just screwing with us atp

I played escape from Tarkov and Elite dangerous all day. I'm not into consoles that much
I think you’ve got a part of it right.   I seriously doubt that China intentionally let the virus loose...but the CCP made a conscious decision to allow it to spread beyond China’s borders.  Their economy would have been completely left behind by the world if COVID was a China-only virus.
Your post is the definition of someone succumbing to an ego lol

Wham! Last Christmas
Look at the 5 or 15min chart for this week. After the first gap up it's been pinned right under 132 all week. Every time it got below 131.80 calls starting pouring in for 1/15 and 2/19. They just needed to accumulate and shake out the weak hands for the real run. 2/19 145 calls were hot.
caught you lying in the past so I've started making it a habit.

No family gatherings this year due to 'rona. On-call for work, so I need to stay sober and near my laptop around the clock. No market to keep me entertained tomorrow. Gonna be a shit-ass Crimmus this year. 🤷‍♂️
Damn...my 'f' key on my MacBook Pro is not working (you have to press harder / multiple times to get it to work).   Not sure what to do, bc even though my laptop is still under warranty, all the Apple stores in California are shut down, and I know if I mail it in, shit will prob. take 3 weeks to get back, and I don't want to be without my laptop forever.

Everyone’s talking about how much they lost on their BABA shares. Who knew you guys bought and held *shares* for longer than a week?
buy the dip
This bitch is rocketing to 1000 the second the ARM acquisition closes
Went with shares. Calls actually seemed kinda expensive. Ofc I'll regret this if it moons 5% Monday.
I dont trade full time.  Do my research nights and weekends, set alerts on think or swim, and then i trade off those. Still check the market periodically throughout the day, but dont stare at it
Imagine being from another country and getting like $2k a month all year. How many calls we could've bought if our country wasnt ran by some bitches.
I still trust Thiel and Li to find a quality target. They’re still going for a big company in that area even if Tokopedia falls through. One of my favorite SPACs
Am I dirt poor struggling to make ends meet or am I just middle class and chilling?
Like a month or less... I don’t think we’re at the bottom. Maybe touch 30. position: shares
Watch some dogs open presents
Did the same with $30k... literally back to even this week
I waited on BABA for a month. Just ditch it my bro’s
It flew, then it came crashing down today. REEEEEEEEEE
I kinda miss those daily shitshows. Fifteen days to flatten the curve!
Fuck Apple, the company not the stock, any other laptop, you could've fixed this yourself in 30 min.

I'm considering venturing into this within the next few years. Assuming this isn't a wsb nonsense post, how did you build a portfolio or book initial clients? I'm assuming paying customers would want to see existing boudoir work before booking/paying. I'm guessing trade for prints or shooting friends  is the way to start.

Let’s hope so
Got some $28 and $30 calls expiring 1/15. Decent amount of time left, but I dunno, the price action the last two days hasn't looked especially promising. Think we got more downside ahead of us in the short term?
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
I'm only playing $20k. WSB isn't memeing it yet so by the time they realize what's going on I'm hoping to exit those positions at big profits and switch over to theta and day trading weeklies on it
Yep puts on BABA and all China internet related shit is the way to go in the short term and maybe long term however things shake out.  Jack Ma is fuuuuucked
Did half of this damn sub own BABA calls? WTF?
Wait how has it been trading flat for 3 months? Amazon actually has been trading flat for 3 months, not WRK though.
AMD will be &gt;$100 in January.  That SE slippery AF tho

❤️ but but that’s not coming til next fall
Long weekends are the worst 😔
BABA is totally undervalued. I don’t want to get fucked by Xi though.
Did you have the funds under the LLC or in your name?
oh interesting i was going for the former situation as well, but figured the suffering "feeling" most of the time would be worse than the actual poor financial situation
I did for fall for the media hype.  Trump was no Rosy either tbh w/ you
Expiring next week dumbass they weren’t dailies
Which stock did India fuck?
I had the iPhone 5S for 2 years, iPhone 7 for 4 years, and now I’m gonna keep my iPhone 11 probably until the iPhone 14 or some revolutionary shit comes out.

You’ll begin to realize we’re all retards and there’s a tiny tiny tiny percentage of people who are actual adults.
It was a love affair back in October. China stocks were more reliable than US ones at the time of great volatility.
Hi
A publicly traded company that exists only to buy another (not publicly traded) company either in whole or in part.
Sorry about the job mate. Always keep your head up. Shit might suck now but next year you’re gonna be fucking shit up.
When others r fearful   Go all in - warren buffet
I FOMOed into a 1/8 $220C. Probably a bad idea so I managed to limit myself to one.
You use it to patch holes in your wall.
BABA briefly went negative YTD today (it's now up 2% YTD end of day today). Very few tech stocks this year are -YTD. Only ones I can think of are Intel and Cisco, but those 2 literally have no growth.
Would I? No  Should you? Do you need the money? That’s what $600 or so after taxes?  How much did you make today from stonks
Baba bruh. They axed it in India.
Imagine closing early just bc it’s a holiday when your business needs all the customers it can get this year
Appreciate it! Thanks
HAVE HAD SO MUCHH WINE 2Nite LETZ FUCKIN GO
Yeah toned down comment in the name of goodwill for fellow man during holidays but exactly right.
There are good dips and bad dips. This is not a good dip, retarded fuck.
Idk why I went so hard on dailies today but I blew through 300 on GME and PLTR today lmao
No, but that big drop was too juicy for likely more than half of this sub to resist.... 220/230 spreads for next week for ~$3ish was my weakness

What is your position?
I grabbed GS.  Much lower float.

Good work keep it up man.  I am down similar %s from my peak and working my way back up, made 36% today so hoping I can maybe make it back in a few months
If AMD sky rockets after I sold my calls I’m going to put su bae on time out
I legitimately wonder how long Ill need to bag hold BABA to get back to 300......  Is it even worth the pain and suffering?
I was just saying hi friend

can you point to a claim that I made that's objectively false?
They offset as long as both gains and losses are realized. So, you need to have closed both positions.
Regardless it still dropped like a rock when the news broke

Given the enormous contracts and shoe deals, it means they must not be great at investing since a lot of popular stocks returned like 5-10x in the last 5 years alone, and most have been playing for longer (some like TSLA, AMD, and NVDA returned even more than that).

30k liquid after my shares getting called away wondering if PMCCs on spy and selling weeklies against them is a good use of my money
IF YOU THINK TDOC FUCKS LEMME HEAR YOU SAY “OOOHH CATHIE BABY”
And they will all pay for their sins soon enough
I probably am. I have some covered calls and the bid ask makes rolling them a money losing proposition for me.
sounds like a name brand to me
My arm hurts too.  But my pp is swole
I bought 4 baba 220 calls 1/8/2021
Merry Christmas

Watching Cathie Woods speak on this not being a bubble but rather a completely different period in time which innovation is at an all time high is turning me tf on 🤤🥵
Goddamit I had 20 PRPL calls that expired last Friday. Of course it goes up this week and jumped way up today. Perfect timing. Nothing to be done but feels shitty.

For everyone that bought the BABA dip, all you’re getting this Christmas is a lump of coal and IV crush in your stocking. Clarity on what this investigation means will take a long time too, so don’t expect a quick bounce and get ready for theta burn too. Enjoy the long weekend. Bah Humbug.
Same here fellow autist. Let’s pray to Winnie the Pooh we can get some profits.

A one off bump in console sales for an otherwise failing company does not warrant a 400%+ pump in the stock price. Long term it’s still going to 0.

I said similar and got my hot sauce in my anus
Bought NIO leaps on sale today 🤤
I was gonna buy the dip and thought about these exact key points and didn’t. I think there’s another drop coming before the slow bounce starts
is the purple dude still in it?
If you're not retarded you would just load up on shares on this dip because yeah timing this recovery is near impossible
How u get it
They need to add some new code to this simulation

Legit would eat her cunt if she let me manage a billion
Shares + selling some OTM calls here. Ofc if it crashes more it doesn't matter since we all will lose. If it moons, then I wish I did calls instead.
At this point, I'd believe that House and Congress are theta gang.

Oh god!!!! I need like 3-5 million to buy a nice house in Bay Area. Stupid shit. Started from -10k last year. I am at +100k now.   What would be a good plan of action if I want to secure 3-5M$ in next 5 years?
That's how I've felt all along but glad to get some confirmation bias from an expert
Absolutely i hear ya. Why not FaceTime them and say hello or turn on a nice movie
That was the way to go. Nice work
Dunno, you can get really long dated calls on baba. I got June 2022 calls. 1.5 years? I think calls are still in play.
Gonna deposit 6k first thing in Jan into my Roth and buy more icln

Too slow
by the time you get 3 to 5 million in 5 years you will need 10 million to buy a nice house in the Bay Area
how far out and how much OTM? and when do you close your positions?  just curious since you seem to have a method to the madness.

Isn't the lockup ending on Jan 1? Usually there is a pump that happens before the lockup expires so that the insiders get a good price to sell (hence I bought today).      Happened with NKLA (R.I.P) and then SNOW (for the first lockup, a second batch of shares gets released the first week of Jan)

My country so poor, government has no money to give out so we have to gamble on stocks to make it ourselves.
Oh damn didn’t know you were holding too. Yeah I’m hoping for some good news in the next month. Only issue is if it’s slow on good news maybe it’s better to put the money elsewhere? But once it starts rising again i think it’ll be worth it. Good luck to us both my dude

i had over 3 weeks to expiration, but I felt like it was gonna have a 10% dip coming up and trade sideways.   ugh sold for like a 25% gain when I could've 5x'ed (and even more potentially).
It’s going parabolic
Why is it that when amd moves nvda moves in alignment together   Like what is this phenomenal effect   I know they both chip makers but why does this happen people can’t be buying both at the exact same time ?

maybe it changes investors perception of the stock if they know there is a large short position
Wtf. Just think what happens when someone shorts a stock
Wait I think it's more like if there are more buyers than sellers -&gt; stock goes up. If there are more sellers than buyers -&gt; stock goes down.   Shorting is just another way to "sell", as in its selling without owning the stock, so it adds to the sell pressure overall. Of course since they don't own the stock, if they are wrong, they have to quickly buy back (cover) adding to the buyers side, causing these short squeezes.

One word - Panic. Just remember shorters sell stock they dont own thinking it will go down and they will return the stock by purchasing at a lower price. They borrow and sell stock of a company they feel is under pressure. If correct, they get to purchase it cheap and return the value keeping the difference.If wrong they lose their pants.

It doesn't. In fact, if you just bought shares in the 15 most short stocks on a rotating basis, let's say monthly or semi-annually, you would outperform the market.
Shorting a stock is essentially borrowing shares you don’t have to sell at market price, which forces the price of the stock down because the market orders are now fulfilled. Then, the short seller buys the shares at the lower stock price and returns them to the brokerage they borrowed them from.

Ya I've had a tough time not putting that money towards other stocks but I am a believer in the company and think it can rip once Biden comes in and RNG gets incentivized.  Good luck.
Yeah bud that’s the real world. You want nice furniture you better open up your pockets or pay for IKEA quality shit

We’re in the NY Times:  https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/24/style/robinhood-2020-recaps.html  “The recap became a meme on the acerbic finance-focused subreddit WallStreetBets; one user created a parodic version of a recap post, revealing extensive losses. (“You made some risky calls…”)”
Aww why thank you!
Don’t kink shame bro
Why would you keep going to a place that rats you out like that. Go to taco bell

Oop ya got me there. You’re right though, communism is when RH trader buy BABA &amp; NIO call
Bullish. You’d better have calls tho

STIC is good, i am all in. but BABA should suffer, so much bad info on that, oh my
I sold some calls Freon $135-139 for 01/08/21 so I'm thinking it won't get past $134 hopefully
Good I can’t have your bitch ass fucking with the one stock I bought the dip on in college when they were passing out double e-coli

Who named you king of the retards jack ass?
The Fed 0% rates has manufactured monopolies, they kept it for 7 years. If not for 0% , money losing companies would have been forced to create profit, or if they go bankrupt, small business will get their customers
How do you feel on this merry Christmas Eve?

Aww. Fuck off you would take my money in a heartbeat.
Have fun in the AM bud!

BABA getting the anti-aircraft gun execution today, with a stray bullet popping ma boi Tencent in the leg. Commies flexing 💪🏼🇨🇳
19 year old guy starts investing big time this year in renewable stuff, obviously makes money in this cocaine fueled market and boasts about it on reddit, meanwhile giving people shit for investing in companies like Exxon because ''they are unethical and he considers the ethics of a company alot'' but is invested in Tesla and motherfucking Disney himself. And weed of course. In my opinion ridiculous.   https://old.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kjlbx7/my_112000_climate_change_portfolio_at_the_age_of/

Baba plz fly next week my bb
I hope Warren Buffet buys up $BABA at these levels!
My father is disciplined and my mother is graceful, together they made me, disgrace
Yeah but more bigger profits are gooder
How u feelin homie,
There is no "set" price for a stock. Buyers place bids, and sellers place asks and whatever matches becomes the latest price. When people short, not only does it increase the number of sellers, they're motivated to sell so they're likely to move their ask price down to the bid. So the bids will just keep getting lower and lower, and the asks will have to come down if they want to sell.   This is why it's a good idea to look at the bid and ask spread when buying things, and why volume and open interest is important.
Buying from other retailers feels good and they’re so thankful for your service. Even send you thank you cards and shit lol
Lindsey still has a grudge from being named Lindsey
Lol
No, lesser gains if you roll it out
Just pay a mule at the border.   Less bullshit.
This guy own more AMZN than most Americans. Show that to immigration.
What are you doing stepbrother?
IWM and small caps are also in a bubble imo. IWM is up 25% on the year with the worst earnings outlook for 2021. I understand the recovery trade but that’s fucking priced in dawg besides maybe a couple names. Since small caps, cloud/security/gaming/ecommerce, EV/solar, mid cap tech are all “overvalued” there’s only two safe havens in the market to throw money in and get a guaranteed return.... mega cap blue chip tech and SPACs. FAANG and SPACs might as well be the new bonds for 2021. How retarded?
We are weak. We deserve this
I'm doing great too! I have short term memory loss like Dory so I already forgot what I lost in BABA today.
I'd settle for a George Bailey esque moment where I have a wife and kids I deeply appreciate and don't take for granted because even if things get tough I remember how bad it would be not to have them
Lol he’ll just buy more KO
How you feel?
Yes sir... 3 bag holders
ARKG 145c 1/15/21 x 50 contracts. Let’s go
That's fair. What is a percentage grow that would convince you that it would have been a good investment? Would 20% in 6 month do it? Would 120% do it? Would beating S&amp;P 500? Obvs I would have no say over it, but just wondering what would be that threshold
Praying for our lil Lawd Jeezus brings tendies to both ghey bears and big c*ck Bulls.

No way it doesn’t bounce. Alibaba is legit, they’ll get a slap on the wrist for whatever they’ve done, and it will soar again
It's not gonna happen until you're liquidated and deep in debt.
Obviously the correct choice is put 600 in PLTR so you can stop starving on behalf of other starving Americans
There usually is, but given the short trading weeks who knows. But it’s typically a few days before.
Instead of shutting the markets down for 3 days, they should decrease the futures margin by 1/2. Give us a volatile treat. Almost like cod 2x XP weekends
Not me. My fractional share will print though 😎

Reinfections are common given the opportunity [[1]](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/khsw6u/scientists_urge_concern_not_alarm_over_new_virus/ggo8qir/). Reinfections can be used to estimate anti-body half life for anti-bodies created by the vaccine. [[2]](https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/antibody+half-life). Reinfections can also be used as an indicator for B cell immunity, as B cell immunity created via a infection is the same as B cell immunity created by a vaccine. [[3]](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html). Yes, vaccines do provide a greater initial antibody count than a natural infection, but the anti-body half life is the same and short as indicated by reinfections. Bi-annual vaccine boosters are not logistically feasible.  If antigenic drift reduces efficacy rapidly, its a problem. Its not possible to vaccinate for multiple versions bi-annually. [[4]](https://twitter.com/trvrb/status/1340409968818671616?s=20). "Immune Evasion" can already be seen occuring in the South African strain [[5]](https://sciencespeaksblog.org/2020/12/22/covid-19-south-african-variant-may-be-worse-than-uk-variant/). Suspiciously, there are also 1594 untested and suspected cases in fda report for pfizer vaccine, in vaccinated group. [[6]](https://www.fda.gov/media/144245/download). The FDA also cleared remdesiver for EUA, and it wasnt okay.

G-H-I-V is going to M-O-O-N.  It's the largest SPAC deal ever.  United Wholesale raked in 1.45B net profit in Q3. It's a beast.  It's going to be the RKT success story that never happened.  Anything below $20 is a no brainer. My PT is $30-40. It's trading at $13 right now.  Going to write up a DD soon.
Wtf, very long didn’t read

Every generation, there’s a massive market bubble that traps retail investors into thinking it’s the easiest thing in the world to double your money, and then on the way down, everyone gets completely wiped out, leaves the market, and misses out on the actual 10-year bull run after. By 2021 EOY, we will have completed this generation’s cycle.

It's real
You are a simulation, get use to it.
True tho
Ghey Bear
Like almost 50% of his holding is AAPL. It's actually funny since buying BRK is like buying a stake that has 50% AAPL but many don't know that.   He probably won't buy BABA with these issues, but if he does, he'll do it directly on HK. I always thought he should buy MSFT but I guess he never will with his friendship to Gates. The next best opportunity was Disney (a safe, boomer stock that has growth) when it dipped to 90 earlier this year, and he didn't do that either...
so what happened in September
Better than anal stenosis. Trust me.
whyd everything i own take a shit today?

It's ok those Tesla (pre-split) 1190 puts that expired worthless on 7/17 can be used to write off up to 3k this year.
Thanks for the tip. If they don't report, then probably there's a reason. Buy puts for next earnings.
Thanks for the tip, Nostradamus.  Now, why don't you make yourself useful and tell us which stock goes on a run in January.

Bruh I love being Hispanic except during the holidays. Everyone always fucking shows up late and the food isnt ready until midnight. Shit is annoying
You want me to be cash gang? That’s how I go cash gang
Just buy AAPL at that point. Berkshire has underperformed for years now while AAPL has gone parabolic.   And it was retarded to not buy any dips in March. The most famous “buy the dip”, “greedy when others are fearful” investor really didn’t see any value in March? Crazy
So what I'm bout to get a lamborghini, my future kids won't give a fck they'll be cruisin chicks with it yo

My Facebook was hacked last week and I'm locked out of it so this is my only option now lol
This is it. The last WSB discussion thread. Get comfy
Yeah, it’s called TacoTime
It's the other way around. Tech stocks have become too overpriced so money is rotating into small caps now.  Because of QE and stimulus, the dollar has been getting killed, so people are just rotating money around looking for a safe haven that still has some juice left to squeeze.  Compare QQQ and IWM since the crash. QQQ went gangbusters until Sept. and has slowed down since. IWM was fairly muted in the recovery, but has taken the lead since the end of Sept.
Does make you more aggressive in reaching goals, gives you alpha mentality
So buy the dip?
I still listen to dubstep

What are these numbers by my name
I hear of you throw enough cash into ARK you get her snap
No I mean it depends on how fast we go back up. I just think it goes up slower than what the IV implies but I like buying the dip. However I woulda bought a closer to ATM call or call spreads or shares (compared to what the OP has).
Lol everyone lol at the 24.5 uup calls expiring the next two weeks...I’m definitely buying that

yeah sure

SPACs still give an advantage to companies, they can negotiate how much they want to go public for like a normal IPO. With direct listing they face risk of being undervalued.

Investing in things that are "good" or civically responsible   is great and all if you believe in the company and/or are worried about having "ill gotten gains", but this is all being traded on the secondary market so you're not financing the company directly.   If you were buying their products or their corporate bonds I get it, you're helping the company, or if youre some pre ipo investor, but otherwise i think its just gambling with extra steps. I agree that it's ridiculous.

Can someone less retarded than me explain the percentage of ETF in the ARK daily emails? For example, look at Google for today. Cathie bought .2681 of google for ARKG. There is no way that’s 26 percent of the fund, is it? And there’s also no way it’s only a quarter of a single percent...unless it is..
Yes I did a Jun 250 and jan'22 260. Those seem like such easy targets, I'd be shocked if they didn't hit for me after all my previous fails...

I imagine being a Perma-Bear is hoping for the downfall of society .  You want things to get worse for other investors, regular average people, working people trying to make ends meat.  You want people you know to financially suffer and you hope to profit off of that suffering.  I can't imagine living my life like this, wanting catastrophic bad things to happen to people for my own selfish gain.

I was on the Tesla train this year, but I think the ship's sailed for those crazy gains now. I feel like Elon keeps throwing buyout scenarios because this is as high as it can go now. I don't think it'll go down, but there's better returns elsewhere.

Hmmm... Cathie bought the dip on Tencent, but not on BABA today
Founders anytime ipa would like a word with you
definitely a quarter of a percent. a fund like ARKG is massive so that’s not a small amount of money. i imagine you need an incredible amount of diversity to keep a fund like ARKG so consistent.

No, we want the market to fairly value things, including labor, buttfuck. When asshole bulls like you drive up energy/commodity prices and short bonds (driving up interest rates), then the economic recovery never happens, and wage earners suffer more. Also, your speculative booms drive up housing and other costs making it harder on wage earners, who are most of the population. Go fuck yourself with a splintery 2x4.

RSI - Relative Strength Index      It analyses Average Gains and Average Losses to measure the speed and magnitude of price movements.      The RSI is always between 0 and 100, with stocks above 70 considered overbought and stocks below 30 oversold. Divergence between the price and RSI can also be analyzed for potential reversals.

It’s not quite that...  Most of them are arrogant beyond a reasonable point and just think they’re smarter than everyone else  They continually try to time “the big crash” to be contrarian and to attempt to be the last one standing holding all the cards while the “retards” are BTFO like some shitty remake of “the big short”.   In reality, the world doesn’t work like that. They get absolutely blown the fuck out most of the time and they spend a lot of time sitting on the sidelines slinging mud and hate at the market and anyone making money off of shares and calls, refusing to accept that their own toxic mindset is holding them back.  They’re annoying. It’s not just you who feels that way.

"The problem with this generation is that they just don't work hard enough, if your job doesn't pay enough or is shut down because of Covid find a better job!

My friends just asked me if I there is a casino. literally do they know they are casinos in town
Folks are on the way over.   Like to play a little game called *“Can Mom Tell If I’m Drunk?”*
I think it's more about the bears thinking the market is overvalued and does not reflect the level of suffering from the pandemic. They're looking for the massive dip to buy in... but that dip hasn't come yet.
No big bad news. No reason to plunge at all but heard talk of it running it’s run, I still think it has some steam in it for NiO day. Such a fucking bummer it’s on a Saturday. And with Biden coming in Chinese EV car companies might be the move..
Wait,  you think if America collapses people wont suffer financially?
AMC shares are so cheap rn I might buy in. Movie theaters will be popping once the pandemic is over. If they file for bankruptcy they likely get to renegotiate their leases. Streaming services are great but my TV has nothing on an actual movie theater. And even if they are acquired by a larger company, it would be good for shareholders.

Lancadia holdings II, holding company owned by Tilman Fertitta is merging with Tillman’s casino Golden Nugget to go public in the iGaming space. Golden Nugget is the only iGaming company that’s already profitable because of physical location and it’s already up n running, it’s the second public iGaming stock and besides draftkings there’s no other public iGaming company to invest in, also their CEO is richer than Mark Cuban and an amazing businessman who owns many companies like Landry’s restaurant group (bubba gump shrimp, mortons, etc) as well as a lot more, he’s always on CNBC everything he touches turns to gold. The merger goes through Tuesday and if you do your research you’ll see that it’s virtually guaranteed to merge, ticker will change soon too. It’s volume and buyers are ATH along with its stock price, up AH, and people are beginning to FOMO. I’m increasing my position Monday while I can. This is going to be big.

This government rarely shocks me but it is straight shocking how much of a mess stimmy talks are
I'm 29, still can't wrap my head around why anyone who has been working this year needs a stimulus check. From what I can tell most people made more money this year, and anyone who didn't or lost a job had massive unemployment supplementation earlier in the year, and also are now getting like 11 more months x 300 which is pretty good.      Juicing the economy at this point with needless stimulus for people like me who had a job all year will get taken back via inflation AND THEN SOME. All you're doing by pounding the table for stimulus is propping up boomer retirements until they die and leave you with an even bigger fucking bag that your dumb ass essentially begged for. The are shitting on younger generations and you guys are just fucking lapping it up like good little dogs.      FUCK THAT. I would love if they would stop manipulating/propping up an economy so that people young enough would have a chance at actually affordable houses and stocks, but nope, you guys would rather try striking it rich on a gambling sub because subconsciously you know it's your only fucking shot at the American dream because the boomer financial engineering has royally fucked you out of a legit shot at wealth accumulation.     But yeah, more stimulus please, that way when I eventually reach retirement age all the gains will have been milked dry by boomers and the dollar will have been so debased that any entitlements I get like social security will be paid out in worthless fucking fiat.      Fuck you people dumb.
they bought a shit load of tencent, but no BABA
I sold around same price, I am not sure I regret it, they are overvalued bigly and bound for a correction.

Only dipshit Americans. Actual poor people who are out there starving to death right now are waiting for our shit to collapse so they can start ganking our shit instead of dying for us to gank theirs. American society treats me like shit for having enough of a moral compass to care more about those people which just makes me care even less about American dipshits and even more about those people. The few American people I know who are decent human beings are free to turn to me for help with survival if things get truly bad for them, my preparations are meant to let me secure the survival of more than just myself, but for the most part the world's rich people such as the US can get fucked for all their murder and thievery

It's all long term positioning. The key is the us house in 2022. Dems barely kept their majority. R need a weak economy and the house flips in 2022 because the incumbent party gets blamed for whatever happens between now and then. It positions them better for a 2024 run with a generic boring R (cotton, hawley etc) and a chance at all three houses for the first time since 2017

Those politicians didn't experience an ounce of hardship and the best they can do is $1,800 stimulus for 9 months of one of the worse global pandemic of the century.
Not bad, you have to really get used to the dips though. I’m really bad at trading so that and shares are the few thing that work for me.
Idk why I'm seeing so many people make this mistake lately but they're called stickers not tickets

BABA doing that thing Boeing did in March
not exactly. Just because you file for bankruptcy doesn't mean the company is shutting down. It allows them to restructure their debts and/or get bailed out by a large company/government. Of course some companies shut down if their restructuring doesn't work, but AMC isn't going to. All they need is time right now for their business to reopen
8 year Bull rally ahead
Oh that's good
I truly hope so
You are right on one thing, the dream is a complete joke and the only way to make it is to gamble on things like WSB.  However 600$ is a drop in the bucket an every dollar you give to the average public gets pumped right back into the economy.
Bought 4400 shares of ICLN at like 16 bucks and 1400 shares of BLNK at 7.50ish. ICLN going to 100 would be absolutely fucking insane.

BABA is just Boeing twice so it makes sense they would follow similar patterns
It’s not a gambling addiction, it’s being a savvy investor 😌
Whatever amount is under 40k after I invest ridiculous amount of income into 401k.  Under 40k income with withdrawal on long stock gains is tax free.  401k, invest 19k, make 19k more, take 21k out tax free.   Can't go tits up

You know what's better than 600 dollars to placate the masses? How about not 600 dollars, and a free fucking market that doesn't inflate asset prices faster than you can catch up to them creating massive generation wealth inequality.      If 600 dollars is enough to make the peons quiet down then money well spent by the boomers I guess.        I'm still waiting for you or anyone to tell me why it makes any sense at all in a year when most people have actually made more money than they would have otherwise, and those that didn't got massive unemployment benefits. Rip the Band-Aid off, kill the zombie companies, burn out the overgrowth. Then instead of hoping you're one of the lucky ones to have an inheritance passed down, you could idunno, have a shot at assets at non manipulated/inflated prices?     This sub would rather beg for a handout which will just end up perpetuating them getting fucked in the end. Seems short sighted.

You're right that we won't stay cooped up forever. But an annual shot wont be enough for covid. covid is much more serious than influenza. people are gonna keep dying from this. and then another super bug will come out in the next 10 years.
"Japan tried several fiscal policy measures to break out of its liquidity trap, but it is generally believed that these measures were not executed well—money was wasted on inefficient public works projects and given to failing businesses. Most economists agree that for fiscal stimulus policy to be effective, money must be allocated efficiently. In other words, let the market decide where to spend and invest by placing money directly in the hands of consumers. (For related reading, check out What Is Fiscal Policy?)"

Except longer to come back? I bought a lot today to lower my cost basis. Wonder if I should just sell monday at a loss or wait till 229 cost and sell at no loss. It will come back but may go to 180-200 before 230 and I want to free up the cash.

Money is for security, health and freedom. After a certain amount, be wary of how much time you spend chasing more, as you may one day look back and say, why didn’t I just enjoy my freedom instead of wasting time. Find a number you want in savings to be secure, go for it, and leave never looking back. You will spend more time in the dirt than you will above it. Cherish it gentleman and women.

Why I'm extremely bullish on ICLN and why you should be too  Feel free to comment on what price you expect it to be at by EOY 2021  &amp;#x200B;  * The strong and growing renewable energy trend is supported by Speedy Joe Buyden’s climate policies, increased global adoptions, and cheaper renewable electricity costs * COVID-19 further pushed ESG conscious investors to sustainable investments * ICLN may be the best ETF to capture the growing renewable energy trend (lowest cost entry, high trading volume) * The fund comprises renewable energy market leaders and WSB fan favorites: Plug Power, Enphase Energy, and Meridian Energy * ICLN is up almost 300%  since hitting a bottom in March * Expect it to continue climbing higher as we move into 2021 and 4 years of Speedy Joe  ICLN GANG STAND UP  &amp;#x200B;  also Merry Christmas everyone

Pretty sure he tried but dems kept shutting it down. The polls said he was going to win a second term so they started blocking everything even if it included helping americans. Speaking of that there was a thing in 2017 that included the wall money before he got it via EO. The bill included the money AND mandatory parental leave for 10m+ corporations. It was one of the biggest wins ever for dems and parent related work rights. Reps put it in so trump could get unlimited wall money, it was a great compromise but they blocked it since it would hand trump a win. THEY BLOCKED MANDATORY PARENTAL WORK LEAVE.

I'd probably buy BABA shares if it hits pandemic levels at around 180. Or LEAPS. TIL LEAPS is an acronym for Long Term Equity Anticipation Security. I thought they were named LEAPS because leaping lets you travel a longer distance than just taking a step.

Spreading thermal paste isn't all that scary but most amd CPUs come with some paste on them already if you don't want higher grade stuff.  Then just grab some ram, an SSD, and a gpu. Also a power supply which I would suggest to not skimp on, high rated psus are more energy efficient and less liable to break and if you go overboard with the amount of power supply you future proof yourself to stuff like newer gpus requiring lots of power.

Holy fuck is it Monday yet
ARK Invest held onto BABA today!!!!!!!
does it have corn?  allergic to corn.  like damn near fucking all Mexican food has corn.
Plays?

I just pissed all over my bathroom floor while reading this
Baba gonna moon monday
I keep rolling mine up and taking profits, might roll it out next month to get a longer dated position. Or yolo the rest of my funds into it as well.
Its double the median income where I live....  rust belt city.
Nah he will just wait for it the flesh to all rot on its own in his garage crawl space.
Has anyone had success following TA? It seems as effective as throwing cards at a wall
Wait, ARK didn't buy more BABA today? Waiting for a bigger dip?
Yo is the market opens for a half day tomorrow too
Would not shock me if they bought more

How I lost $6k in shares on a $56k portfolio in 3 days.  How is this possible
Already said it on my other account and got banned
It’s not going down- it’ll be up in fact. Retail investors nabbed a little bit of profits with low Volume. Big boys back in and have to deal with only 4 days to cover puts.
How much u got?
No
It’s basically all corn stewed with pork meat
I’m in with 5k shares. Why do you think it’s going to rocket? 🚀🚀
That scene fucked me up fr
thoughts on fastly now - i have shares that i've had for a couple months and up a little.   should i sell or hold? what is the latest on the acq. rumors?
This is BULLSHIT markets should be open 24/7
I have used it to know when to buy TSLA dips and when to bail
i could use someone like u
Did you have the previous model? I have a Ps4 and only play warzone with friends. I don't see a need to go out and buy a ps5 for slightly better graphics and a new controller.
Anytime a stonk sells off, like BABA, that creates resistance to any future increase. It can overcome eventually, especially with good news, but betting on a quick recovery for BABA, is well, stupid.
No 🙈
I will take this as gods word. Can’t fuckin wait to get my tendies

If the mods have truly forsaken us, I can't tell the difference. Maybe it's cause it's a slow trading day/holiday weekend. We'll see how bad it is come Monday I guess
What do you look at for those?

I don't think that's right but I don't know enough about Santa Claus to dispute it.

HELL YEAH USA TECH GONNA MOON BABY
Thanks now that I have your attention can I please have a “JPows Butt Plug” flair. Would be the best Christmas present ever dad
nice
They don’t “suck” but usually skimp on things like power supply, mobo, case quality and low quality RAM. But they’ll have the CPU/GPU combo.   Get yourself a good quality PSU, screen and case since those are permanent. Then find yourself a good deal on an AMD cpu (good luck lol) and then sell your ass so you can afford a mid-range GPU. Then GTFO of this sub, you’re in the wrong place nerd.
If the cold was going to kill them wouldn't they already be dead working at the hospital?

Mods said HAPY CHRISTMAS
Downvoted 😡
Blago did nothing wrong
Jokes aside have you done straddles on spy?
I was just wondering that myself
With calls, when do you guys normally sell your positions?   I usually buy monthlies (or further out if price is okay) and have been selling with plenty of time left and before decay (&gt;2 weeks left) to give me cushion in case it drops.   Last few plays, the underlying has skyrocketed after I sold with plenty of time (PRPL and RIOT for example), so I realized 30-75% gain instead of 5x+.   How do you guys balance being safe and closing out for a marginal gain versus holding?
How hot is your mom?
😢 merry Christmas bro 💪
You probably have shares
Mods on strike no weekend discussion lol
Finally flaired up. Not homeless like you degenerates. Merry Christmas freezing outside my fellow retards ❤️

lmfao no, i don’t think i’d really want to either tbh. seems like a waste of money. but selling *strangles* on spy (if u don’t use robinhood like me🤢) seems like a lucrative prospect

it's Christmas Eve
still crying?
My new Christmas tradition is being over leveraged on meme stocks
Merry Xmas dad
you're mentally ill
inshallah brother🙏🙏
I got a dutch oven for Christmas, gonna take a stab at making some dutch oveny meals. My braised short ribs are bomb.
Imagine giving someone a key bump in front of all these flair fiends
I’d love to smoke some dank medical weed
Googs is going up????
Holy fuck you changed my life
The only market that matters is the SPAC market
I wish I had a better flair :(
sure ya did.  must've been between hits of the meth pipe
Your wife’s boyfriend must be pissed.

Merry Christmas Autists. May we lose slightly less money next year.
Congrats. Now you will feel some extra guilt when you lose some meaningful cash on FDs.
Bullish.

I’m going to start a coffee shop called degen only for degenerate gamblers.
Don't know about the stock but their wayfair service is the shittiest in history.

Shitclown
How much upside do you see?
Yeah. I was around back then and it felt kind of like they found the one dude who didn't have any real power to be the poster boy for corruption. I mean senate seats aren't just handed out when there is a vacancy. It's usually the biggest and most loyal asskisser
you're mentally ill

What happened to the mods?
You mad
I got clean
mmmm tears yum
This thread is dead. Stop spending time with your in-laws and get back here now!
Dumb question: but how much $ is one 10 bagger? Is that like a percentage in multiples of 100 therefor multiplying it by 10?

Has anyone been to a buffet recently? I could murder a Chinese buffet rn. Load up on wontons, noodles, that beef on a stick thing, top it off with a couple slices of pizza for some reason. And for dessert? Jello for some reason.
Could go back to 517 before going to 530 if it breaks 530  it’ll continue to climb 🧗‍♂️
Is it undignified to beg not to have a flare?
If u smoke anything pure with no man made chemicals u will stay healthy. Cigarettes, vape, and hooka are harsh for the body. Wanna live long stick to natural
Bad Santa is such a good representation of America.

Thinking anything China makes me sick to the stomach right now

Basically. People don't really get that in the real world. There are legit types that if you cross they will turn over every rock to screw you over and there is no recourse. Either the fix is in or people are afraid of them. Works the same way in the job force. In some fields if you cross person x then good luck finding a job you're on a blacklist
I'm curious about the % of ppl here that use margin. What's y'alls guess?
Here here Sir
Any recommendations for good books about this?
Anyone else have a mantra they like to repeat to themselves? Mine is "kill urself" always makes me laugh I'm like "hahaha I won't do that, good one though" then I'm like "yeah but you should, probably" "you make a convincing argument" "stfu f\*ggot" then I feel humiliated

I prefer butter
Yeah that’s easy.
Yeah - agreed, but it's tough when you see shit rally after closing when you have time left.  For those 600% calls, I'm curious when you are happy with the gains and sell? Like you had to make a conscious effort to hold pass 200%, 300%, etc. In other words, when is it enough to sell.  I'm always worried that if I hold, the underlying could tank and I can see my gains get wiped out, which has happened all too many times.

What’s the next 10 bagger
I think it is better to sell based on the shares price and technicals rather than the option price, something i am still learning and working on

The medicinal effects of THC have literally been proven to offset the harmful effects of the smoke to varying degrees, with good high-THC weed likely getting enough of this effect to completely cancel out the harmful effects.

carts/pods are the same thing essentially - if bought from shady places they may be cut with Vitamin E Acetate or other similar agents. Long term use of shady carts may cause you to develop a relatively dangerous and deadly pneumonia which used to only be found in nursing room patients on oxygen. Furthermore, carts are sometimes cut with spice/k2 to “enhance the high”. These are horrible for you. Long term consumption of synthetic cannabinoids WILL cause you to develop mental problems such as bipolar disorder, depression, and even psychosis.   Smoking bud in joint form repeatedly carries many of the same risks found in smoking - while the risk of cancer is much lower than smoking cigarettes, it can still happen. More importantly, long term joint/cart smoking can cause widespread lung issues such as COPD.   TLDR:  Edibles &gt; Dispensary Carts &gt; Dispensary Weed &gt; Regular Weed. In my opinion I wouldn’t take the risk of street carts. They used to give me mad headaches and definitely we’re not good for me.

I could see that. Whether or not he wins is a better question. While he has the gravitas his base loves, four years out of the spotlight and america's penchant to forget about people once they're out of the spotlight could end up sinking his candidacy. Of course this is assuming he doesn't launch trump tv and become a 24 hour eye sore

Thanks this basically answers my question. I buy from someone who gets it from the dispensary. I usually use carts but he’s out and only has pods. Plug play and stizzy are the options. So assuming it’s legit and similar to carts they’re both safe and essentially same as smoking just flower?
Holy shit, comments getting deleted left and front

Not enough for sure, I’ve been kind of trading off my own gut. I have started looking at RSI, MACD, and Volume indicators but I definitely think I need more experience to make confident plays off those  I haven’t done terribly portfolio wise, I bled from 7000 all the way to 1.8k on SLV calls (what didn’t help was that I took a day trade ban and diamond handed the slv calls hoping for a pump that never came) from July to November 4, but am now back up to 6.2 on my Robinhood from NIO, QQQJ, PLTR, JOE, CRSR, and GME weeklies being my biggest gains

Thanks he who cannot be named after yesterday
does it scan individual stocks?
If he is heating a potato then adding butter and bacon or something to it, then eating it, it is a baked potato.   Even if the heating occurred wrapped in paper towels in the microwave.
Friends are ok but a girlfriend is a better start. It can be very awkward in the beginning, so having a relationship with your model can help a lot. I built my portfolio by reaching out to models on Instagram. You can definitely offer your work for free in the beginning, but I would try and keep that to a minimum (maybe let them use some shots on their social media). Goodluck!
I think so, it seems to be the move lately, just get out when it pumps.  Pick one that looks like it has potential to get some momentum via who owns it or the bs product they may sell
During the March crash, some SPACs did drop under $10 but not too much, stay above $9 and went back up above $10 eventually. Biggest downside I guess is waiting for it to do something while missing out on other trades. Once the merger completes though, no more $10 floor.
Saw a post yesterday that one of the mods quit and turned off some bots
Woahhhhh what adodge
Should just put them both in the microwave and see which one turns out better
Merry lockdown
But the charts are calling my name.
Apollo bro  0 ads and much better browsing experience
She's not wrong
Depends on if I see a large catalyst in the horizon, if the news has hit then I definitely sell.  I'm currently sitting on some gme calls that have appreciated a lot but I feel confident that better gains are on the horizon so I'm chilling. Usually I'm happy to leave at 50-100% gain though, reminding myself that that amount of gain blows away what you'd get with regular stock.  I also spent like 70$ on 35$ calls that were worth like 800% more and I almost definitely should've sold before they went back to earth but I sometimes I just need to scratch that itch lol
Ublock origin
Hey sodomites, what’s the play for Monday?
I hate the guy but I will tell you something. He did shake up the normies and they'll never be the same. Not the political process because absent a civil war that won't change.  But he basically shattered normal political positions among voters. Take a look at the nytimes analysis of how major cities shifted towards trump this year. He effectively convinced a group of younger minorities that voting D means you're a wage slave forever and voting R means a chance at prosperity.   Bad dude all around and one if I shook hands with I'd check all my pockets and wrist to make sure nothing was missing but he was highly effective at breaking up the passive political thought pattern
What kind of ads do you mean. Like 100 posts bout PLTR and GME?
Here’s some flair bitch

What’s the difference with any DD posted here? If you make DD then chances are you bought it was low before the hoped pump WSB will give
Simple stuff like finding trend lines and watching the volume when candles touch the trends
That's not exactly how the Biblical story goes.  He was born to die for our sin, for those that trust in Him for that mercy at least.
How come allowing the president to "pardon" anybody he wants above all law is not dictatorship?
What if the mods were all bots the whole time 🤔
If you swipe only on people in your league then you'll get matched back by those types. If you swipe on all then you get only the worst
Enjoy
I agree. But you asked how to stop losing money. Only other option is make better picks but we don’t know nothing about that around here

There are only 30 ICU beds remaining for 10 million people in LA county. I believe the number 2 weeks ago was 92? Basically, get it while u can cuz we’re about to be sold out of hospital space

even during World Wars the soldiers had truces on Christmas.
I’m not a fan of carts. I prefer either vaping flower or dabbing concentrates. Take some of your gains and buy yourself a vaporbrothers vaporizer. I’ve had the same one for the past 10 years and it still works very well. Vaporizing is the healthiest form of smoking. You bake, not burn, the herbs, and don’t inhale the carcinogens that are produced when you burn the herb. Your lungs will thank you

I made a lot of money on PRPL. It wasn't hard assuming you didn't YOLO into retarded short term OTM calls
Yeah but like, that’s so lame.   I get it tho bro, I hope belief provides too comfort, I get comfort in shitposting lol

Gaaah if I would have held on to my Tesla play I'd've doubled my money, but I managed risk and will break even. Fuck

11 year old cousin left his switch at my house this evening, looking to pawn it for some weeklies. If your interest hmu ASAP. Merry Christmas :)
There you go
Well heres what happened to me today while my entire portfolio was bleeding -- which became a theme for the day.  Wife was on her period, I didnt get laid, she somehow got a backrub and convinced me to go buy her a new blood red minivan.
That's fucking hot
As far as I'm concerned every other user is a bot and reddit is a one player game
What songs do y'all listen to while you trade? I've been throwing this one on a lot lately: [Sisters of Mercy - Dominion / Mother Russia](https://youtu.be/0NqBJQksIIo). I like it because it was written at the tail of the cold war by some British goth intellectual and it shouts out Ozymandias and then compares Lloyd's of London to blind men and mine workers and accuses Reagan of being a Russian puppet and it ends on a posadist prayer for Russia to nuke America but if you play it in reverse it says "have mercy" a bunch of times so that there's some voodoo shit going on where every time you play it you might think you're praying for nuclear dominion but actually you're being cancelled out by a prayer for world peace. Pretty nifty shit. I feel like it gets the devil to stay out of my way and I can just vibe with Putin the richest man alive and f e e l the market when this song is playing. Right now I'm listening to it and it's telling me the market is closed so yep the sixth sense checks out
could be a while. today was a write off tho. every hhigh flying stock sold off on low volume
well whatever you get the idea.
Lol is this an algo thing or a universe energy type of deal
That’s literally how the American health care system works
All those super spreader protests lolol
Spread eagle and and pretend it's Papa Elon 🤟
The in law effect will give it significantly higher volume than the weekend dow
Buying cheap champagne too
I feel like I should just put my whole portfolio in ARK funds. I’m already up $10K on them in two months.
Yeah +Thanksgiving which we’re seeing the affects of
I listen to the Borderlands 3 soundtrack.
your DD is priced in
What’s their drink of choice? A lot of the “fun kind” of alcoholic depends on their poison
Thank you! You tha MVP 😊
Why is my wife so fucking hot? Why am I in so much debt? Why am I so drunk all the time?
Yeah but they bought weeklies before earnings lol

Imagine a bot quarreling another bot over making other bots
It would be worth more than apple
It's Tinder's algorithm to punish robots and people who swipe right on all. It rewards real people who are realistic about swiping in their league. I'm an average looking guy sha I've never had a problem getting cute-ish matches because I learned about ELO

Any reason other than ARK is buying it? (and why have they been buying it)
Dude the whole pardon thing is wild. I can’t believe we let people do that lol
No not that
Fast and Furious is on Telemundo and I kinda wanna watch but I won't understand anything they say lol
Wsb retards have no patience

Hey palantards here’s some Christmas confirmation bias: PLTR broke out the wedge, did a nice consolidation, and is nicely undersold on RSI. Next week we about to explode🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
She'll probably say the people elected Trump... the illuminati elected Biden, so I win.
Low key big brain move tbh

She only picks winners my friend
It’s okay I drink them in nice houses
You sick fuck. Take my upvote. Merry christmas Ebenezer.
Finished 7% up today.  I feels smarts.
Trashy fucking poors just down light beers all day. Mainly Coors

MC saying ENPH gonna rip next year too.  Is this a good company.  Seems to be doing well.
There's plenty of room on there for a few guys. 😏
This looks like the comfiest couch I've ever seen.
My grandpa used to run a sizable chunk of L of L. Can confirm. He was a shit businessman.
I feel like a bot somedays too😞
Is it even a year, yet?
Yeah, ditto - if there's a catalyst that drove me to buy it in the first place, i definitely hold on till that happens, but sometimes I just feel the stock is underpriced and make a little gamble.

GME?
Why not, the rest of us are
This guy definitely didn't have BABA options.
Dude, having a hot wife is super dope. The debt isn't fun. But maybe take a closer examination of the drinking. I'm sure your hot wife would be less likely to run if you're not drunk all the time... Hope you have a good Christmas!
robotwars
Yep, agreed with you here. I'm normally looking at the stock price as well, but in most cases, the option price follows pretty squarely.
I once got seasick on a cruise and spent a day watching Zoolander in each of the 7 languages available
I'd say that's a better explanation
Thanks :)
yeah i've talked myself way up the price i'm willing to pay but fuck it i guess
That's a big ass couch.
Fugly af imo but comfy af and idc about design so pull the trigger
fembois preferred
Yeah this song is prophetic tbh. For years I thought Trump probably didn't collude with Russia but this song says it's been going on since Reagan and that convinced me
I listen to the sound of money coming in
Yeah that’s the problem, wine or marg alcoholics usually more fun.   Natty or coors is just sad tbh, also super inefficient at getting one shitfaced.   I’m a vodka alcoholic, I like to think I’m moderately entertaining, maybe not fun tho
This is exactly my reasoning for holding GME after Q3 earnings did the same thing.
Tldr appreciated
That's just mean
It's an interesting one. A short seller basically said they're a fraud and their crap doesn't work. But you know it's worth like $20B
Well what is the human synapse and neurons but open and closed gates. Checkmate universe.
Your wife is only hot because you're drunk, so it sounds like you're just a problem solver.  The debt is because you're an American.
Any PCT? How do you feel?
Imagine imagining
God bless icln
aapl 💪  but that money is just in ARKF &amp; CLOU shares
Citron?
Is that... Good? For your trades?
Presicne
i'm so retarded when it comes to interior design i couldn't tell u if it's ugly or not.
Interesting because Enphase has a pretty good reputation in the solar arena.
I’ll consider this next time I’m not in excruciating pain while trying to trade
even during World Wars soldiers had truces on Christmas.
I'll be so bitter if that goes through. WSB been shilling and losing on FLIR since April maybe even March.
yeah it’s almost as if an options value is derived from of the underlying asset  but yeah what i meant was people should not have an exit strategy like “sell at x%”, because it often doesn’t make sense given the technicals and price movements - the market doesn’t give a fuck about your exit strategy

**[List of people pardoned or granted clemency by the president of the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List of people pardoned or granted clemency by the president of the United States)**  This is a partial list of people pardoned or granted clemency by the President of the United States. The plenary power to grant a pardon or a reprieve is granted to the president by Article II, Section 2, Clause 1 of the Constitution; the only limits mentioned in the Constitution are that pardons are limited to federal offenses, and that they cannot affect an impeachment process: "The president shall ... have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment".Though pardons have been challenged in the courts, and the power to grant them challenged by Congress, the Court has consistently declined to put limits on the president's discretion. The president can issue a full pardon, reversing a criminal conviction (along with its legal effects) as if it never happened.

That sweet spot where you are down thousands in your overall realized cost basis for the year but you have unrealized winners you can cash now without tax stress 🙌
It's actually 100% bangers.  No words so it's not distracting, and it's all fast paced, driving beats.  I honestly keeps me focused better than any drug.
You think I should still hold GME or get out while I can? Bought like an idiot at 20.95 today
I'm taking the high road.  you're taking a lower road  than a former meth addict.

You sir; why the fuck are you living in a cardboard box?

Lgd, mk 677, cardarine and yk11.     Lgd, I fucked up and took too huge a dose and had shutdown, but 3 weeks back to normal.
Yeah I feel like what sucks about wsb is that most of the talk around here has happened after things have run up and not before. I fucking wish I had seen someone talk about gme earlier in the year
This guy imagines
If we keep going, Jim Cramer might come back.
Bring back mango juul pods and put the vaccine in Them and I’d be immune to every coronavirus ever

No doubt. I remember reading the report and staying away. It's either the next big thing or the next Enron given how lofty the expectation are for it
not if this au pair chick wants to fuck  so yeah me too
If you're ever looking to change it up, LittleBigPlanet soundtrack is good for the less intense trading days especially if you get any nostalgia from it
Got that on my rotation too. Outstanding for your trades.  "Wit' my mind on my money and my money on my mind"
Get out now, buy back later. Hold PLTR, might have a big move during the next week.
Yea for sure
You have an ELO score too that the algos look at based on what type of women are swiping on you. Unless the 10s are also swiping you back, then it treats you like a robot. Swipe the type that swipes you and then it will keep showing you yo those types
Oh yah that’s not good at all. Esp with light beers like that, there’s almost no alcohol in them. Sorry to hear that bro, I’m sure in a few years we’ll be able to grow replacement livers.  Or we could just go to China for a parts swap
That’s not a flair that’s an award 😂 I was so excited I thought you were a mod for a second 😂😂  But nonetheless thank you. I appreciate it my man 🙏🏾
Even geothermal joined the energy rally-- ora is up 50 percent in 3 months.  I always wondered if congress renewed the subsides for this if solar would lose market share. It's a low maintenance system and the energy is limitless

Again? If so, it's because STIC's market cap is under $1bn. Think as of EOD it's like 540 MM, so it's easy to manipulate currently.
Wife on period.  She says no.
I would decide based on premarket levels.
damn that’s tough. It’s like that I guess lol. How does it know who’s hot and who’s not? Number of swipes?

Good advice. I hate being on the pacific coast
you're worse than me bro
She gregnant?
Yeah it's really that simple
If I win, I don't want the award. I eschew material possessions such as Karma and Reddit Awards.
I could get behind that. Assuming the price point for retail broadband is under $50/mo
Yes
I can't say it often. but you're actually even worse than me bro.
We're allowed to pass inside Information on Christmas right?
Yep. Just look at the YTD charts for the ARK funds.
Yeah completely agree. Definitely a fomo driver.

What’s everyone up to tonight my kneegrowths?
Definitely the year to yolo. That  pump over the summer was insane
Did you buy calls or shares. Because the RSI is high so I wouldn’t be surprised to see a pullback but it’ll rebound. So if you have shares you’ll be good
What is tax stress?
Hi self
It's for the kids! Not our declining revenue!

Thanks man. I accepted at a young age this was how it would be and unfortunately I was right so I just don't feel any type of way about it anymore :/ just waiting to leave it behind.

1) to the moon! SUNE got delisted shortly after WSB noticed it.   2) MU 7/20 90 calls in 2018 They were pennies at the time and MU was trading in the 50’s with a PE of 6 or something insane like that. Expectations were so high for earnings, which beat, but still traded sideways   3) msft- we all know what happened in March
Dribble some honey in my ears and I’ll tickle your biscuits, ya know what I’m saying?
I read the prescience article too and they were way off base with their predictions. They were calling for delisting and everything lol.

Can we get a legit support post up for Cramer?  Fuck the dipshits on Twitter giving the guy a hard time when he is on vacation with his family.  we all know that here we shrug off losses and laugh it off.  Even if he werent on vacation nobody can fucking predict what communist China will do to protect the communism.
looks uncomfortable for sitting.
How are you even concerned lol
I get that the funds are amazing, but isn’t it just driven by Tesla and apple and stuff?  I’m sure anyone that buys Tesla has done better than 100% return this year.  More curious about how many of the other picks are winners after she buys them

Chest, why is this even a question?
They'll probably just start kicking out the low need people...what is the average number of beds available?
Xi admired Mao. He believes in core tenet of communism. He is pragmatic and learnt from mistakes of other communist countries. No need for state owned companies when you have control over private sector.
If it bothers him that much maybe he should just log off twitter. He's a grown ass man fuck him. It's words on a screen at the end of the day.

You deserve to lose all your money to gay bears in a big crash and you probably will. There is justice in the world
If the skin is still on, then the flesh is steamed in both of these preparations bro. Theyres a ridiculous amount of water in a potato. That's why you don't see any maillard reaction in the flesh no matter how high your oven goes

Time for a pump then.  Bears in shambles.
Get the timing wrong then bitch
It’s basically a casino at this point.  If it’s on the watch list, you’re going to miss the move while you debate if it’s the right time.  Just throw money around and hope you get lucky.    Do your own DD.  Don’t chase memes.
Everydays arm day bro
Nice, what was your winning position?
don't worry about it, it's no different than when your car wants that  it's specified in bluetooth: [https://www.bluetooth.org/docman/handlers/downloaddoc.ashx?doc\_id=457095](https://www.bluetooth.org/docman/handlers/downloaddoc.ashx?doc_id=457095)  bluetooth is extremely short range, too

ComputerTE1996 already cashed out most of his THCB he said
I hadn’t seen that, but I can see why. I’m holding on this time; I sold CIIC (his previous DD) too early.
I agree. Which is why I asked lol. Pissed at myself for not getting in sooner, although I wonder if it’s success is largely from its PLUG holdings. Interested to see what 21 holds.
Sorry I’m embarrassed now
Thanks for the info man, I’ll check it out tonight and look up those terms as well. I really appreciate your help as I am eager to learn more and have done lots of research on companies themselves, just not as much TA / market sentiment stuff.
I’m with this guy
Happy holidays and merry Christmas mate!

Wait what happened to the mods?
The one that cares left and the rest are are either lazy or salty about jarcuck getting kicked or both.
Lol mitch is pissed at mango
just in case Trump goes to war with Iran?
Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house   Not a short-seller stirring, not even a mouse;   The heavy bags were hung by the chimney with care,   In hopes that St. Powell soon would be there;   The bagholders were nestled all snug in their beds;   While visions of tendies danced in their heads;   And Cassandra in her 'kerchief, and Left in his cap,   Had just settled their puts for a long winter's nap...      Merry Christmas  to all of you!
Got some MT shares, will that do?
It’s N G A   He already said a week or two ago that’s his January play
Who knew mango would be out for blood after he didn’t win? /s
Stonks are fun but family makes life worth it. Hope everyone enjoying Christmas eve or just enjoying their night. I am. No homo, if youre not and dont have anyone to talk to, feel free to send me message tomorrow. I wish all my bull, bear and theta brethen a happy holiday
? Rsi is an indicator. There’s no ambiguity. It’s under 30, it’s oversold. None of those timeframes have an rsi under 60!
LDR's don't count.
New thread dude.
He sold out of the AMZN calls and is down 160k on 285 Facebook calls. Not so sure with theta burn
Thanks for the heads up, I'll post there
The worst vaccine is BCG (for TB).  The area you get the shot would look infected and ooze shit for like 2 weeks.  You will get a scar on your arm for the rest of your life from it.
That was a weird rabbit 🐇 hole to go down on Christmas Eve!
thank you again for doing these, really appreciate the work you do.
PINS? ROKU? OAC? CRSR? PLTR? DKNG? APLE? AMZN? Already have my MT calls end own some Tesla. Not enough money for all. 20k to invest total. Please put me out of my misery and help.   Also, I’m a chick. Hope that’s enough to get me some replies.
They only dropped 33%, I'm pretty diversified so net -5%. I rolled into some leap credit spreads for pltr and saw some gain back
Those who went balls deep in GME calls last week are swimming in both money and panties right now.  If you nut in one of these chicks either tell her jk and she won’t get pregnant, or just be a gentleman and serve her a delicious Plan B smoothie tomorrow morning as a nice little Christmas gift. She won’t even know.
Yeah that’s why I go also. I know it makes her happy so my pain is worth it. Unfortunately my parents aren’t super worried about Covid and my dad hates wearing masks. Luckily the church as social distanced and it wasn’t terrible.
so is monday gonna be super red cuz i highly doubt they stimmy gonna be passed...
Don’t sweat. My ICLN call went down for like 4-5 days straight and then flew and now I’m up 150%, patience :)
So if the amended 2k stimmy bill doesn’t pass, can they just override the veto for the original bill or do they have to go through the voting process again?
What did you learn?
Ok what’s the craic with stimmy
Chest day best day
I got laid this afternoon, Maybe round two coming
600 attached to defense spending bill, but maybe another 2k of trump signs it asap
Stimmy passing and not passing is both priced in.
Spy +3.5% open Monday.
LOL.
"I'm gonna give you my personal line, if you ever need to talk to me, 5 days a week just feel free"
if you apply that logic to stocks like TSLA you'll lose money  yes, RSI is an indicator, imagine interpreting something differently than another person and getting better results  place your bets bro
it will be even funnier when he's right and the CNBC headline is "Trump vetoes stimulus bill.  Millions to lose unemployment insurance."
They somehow broke physics and became even more 🌈.
Spy -3.5% open Monday.
Merry Christmas
if it  happens it doesn't matter to me. i have a couple tech plays and then 30% of my portfolio is UUP calls.  but i'll still laugh if bears get fucked again
Why UUP calls? What makes you think the dollar isn't going to continue dying?
merry christmas
rectangle. nnowhere to put your legs . dont want to be lying down oall the time
Wow, someone that has a dollar position.. amazing. You must actually know what you're doing..
nope i'm completely retarded and my logic is "dollar went down, dollar will go back up"  but I promise you it will work  i'll update you a year or two from now
it could go down further, but at the same time if the market takes a dive it works as a hedge  and I can average down on the calls until it starts to recover, which I'm pretty sure it will
With the stimulus sure to pass eventually and the billions being printed each money next year, I don't really see the dollar going up any significant amount. I also don't have a good grasp on what makes the dollar move either so I'm just guessing.
What a great day
Thanks for making a thread "bot" (not bot) mod.
But not today. Tomorrow.
Bulls gonna get DP’d by Elmo and Clifford Monday morning after Trump vetos the stimulus and the government shuts down.
Turn on Patterns as well. I also create my own trend lines from the past low candles to the low of current candles and vice versa from the top of the highs. I do this from several time periods. The farther out and more candles the line touches the  more confirmation of the trend line and where the stock will move within the future. By using the macd + volume + ttc squeeze I can gauge where the stock will likely move for shorter term trend lines. A good indicator of change is using a triangle where both high and low lines meet within a channel. This is usually at a point of a reversal or stabilizing event.    i have found the market is aware of these points and usually you get a lot of activity if you are looking at the active trader window. Thats where RSI and MACD are important to see if the price has momentum to break up into a higher channel or drop below. Don't be afraid to keep making lines and extending them to patterns that you see. More points confirmed + Time = the more likely the stock will move in that direction.   Granted this does not take in account random events and news breaks that alter the momentum and volume. Even then I have typically seen that price movement will stay within the broader channels. If it breaks the channel I typically account for a correction.   Im new to this as well and have been studying as much as possible. The results have been positive. I was able to gauge aapl and gme movement within +-5 cents for 24hrs allowing for quick trades. Again volatility, news, as well as future time trends in a stock create more unknowns. Once you find the pivots gauge the downside and upside and have a entry exit plan for which way the stock chooses to go. (Options also will need to factor in theta decay) IE the stock hits a channel but the movement is to slow to be profitable.
here's what i've gathered so far:  \- the fed raising rates  \- investors dumping equities for cash  \- weakness of other currencies as a safe haven relative to the dolllar  I saw what happpened in 2008 and when obama left office we had a chad dollar  i think the same thing will happen again but no one wants to admit that the fed has to raise rates eventually -- they will, my calls are for 2023
Becky Quick is such a blatent bitch, I would love to shit in her mouth
yeah it prolly won't set it up that way. each piece is separate and i'd probably go 4 wide and more trinational couch instead of 3 wide and a rectangle
I think the Fed said they'll keep interest rates where it is at least for all of 2021.   2023 expiration, I'm sure rates will go up by then.
Palm day
Look at me, I'm the weekend thread now
I actually did hurt my wrist so maybe that would've been a better call lol
what do yall usually buy your wife's boyfriend for xmas
Is it custom to get your wife’s boyfriend something for Christmas?
Yea that along with IV are really the keys for option pricing.
Guys I’m gona buy more ETF’s and I’m gona post the gains again...only shares ok 🙋🏻‍♂️🤝
Puts on msft
She's starting to believe, you should get out while you can.
The weird thing is I only hung out with her once. 😂 Also dope profile, plan on getting a Hanuman tat soon.
Why?
I always feel like as someone who is heavily into ARKG and bought calls on ICLN that I am somehow the conservative 'safe' investor when i come to WSB despite the fact those are still quite risky in the broader financial scheme. Most of my money is in ARKG, ARKW and ICLN because I believe they'll crush it down teh road at prices that are much much higher than what we have now.   I like your distinction though, makes a lot of sense
Is dexamethasone already priced in or are we YOLOing into Pfizer, Novartis, and Merck next?  + https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexamethasone  + Dexamethasone is recommended by the National Health Service in the UK and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the US for patients with COVID-19  + https://www.thomasnet.com/articles/top-suppliers/dexamethasone-manufacturers/  + Top Dexamethasone Manufacturers in the USA: Pfizer, Novartis, Merck
**[Dexamethasone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexamethasone)**  Dexamethasone is a type of corticosteroid medication. It is used in the treatment of many conditions, including rheumatic problems, a number of skin diseases, severe allergies, asthma, chronic obstructive lung disease, croup, brain swelling, eye pain following eye surgery, and along with antibiotics in tuberculosis. In adrenocortical insufficiency, it should be used together with a medication that has greater mineralocorticoid effects such as fludrocortisone. In preterm labor, it may be used to improve outcomes in the baby.

Hanuman is cool  I like Garuda but we never make him for some reason.
Garuda is interesting! But yeah it’s kinda complex, depending on where you’re at they have different belief systems. I know some places have Ganesh with a broken tooth on his right side. Some still worship Vedic gods, etc.
cuz they just got hacked
Q4 will be by far the best yet, if you go to the website, like 80% of their mice and keyboards are sold out
Lol okay, retard. The rsi by definition is not oversold unless it’s under 30, that’s a 20 year PLUS standard.   So many fucking idiots in here, I wish we could go back to 250k
If all of you retards buy 10 shares of GME at open on Monday, we can all afford to eat instant ramen on Tuesday.
u right
Scorched earth Mango is ripest Mango
A rhetorical one
Thanks for adding the clowns, saves me the trouble! My point is that you are super late on the train.
Where in my comment did I ask anyone to hop in now? Are you dyslexic or just retarded?
Merry Christmas to all you tards out there. May you all get tendies for Christmas this year.
sold 10 puts for 5.
Merry Xmas.  to those of you spending it alone due to covid. stay strong.
What do u think investors said during the dotcom bubble? kek
I mean worst case I have to wait a couple of years but I highly doubt that it'll take very long
I doubt it’ll go down much in the short term. Thinking that the sell off happened last week. The same thing happened with QS and it’s stock doubled in a week
Can't wait to see $SPY hit $370 in 2025 guys!
Im strangling the fudge out of PLTR so I'm loving all the price movement.
Nah everyone is already using it and has been since March.
Because the stock has moved more on Thursday than it has on any other day in the last five years
Watch PSTH take one of Elon’s private companies public. Bill was trying to work out a deal with Elon a couple months ago with Howard Hughes Corp &amp; a new Tesla plant in their Texas properties. Don’t think it materialized, but Bill would be down to worth with Elon
I saw some but I dont trust them as they wont tell you whats up on the 5v5 teamfights where every1 is ulting and shit is going on
Risk and reward can’t be separated in a (nearly) efficient market, so the more reward you want the more risk you have to take. These things are a spectrum, meaning that you can choose to gamble and invest on the same stock depending on the position you take. PLTR shares or LEAPS (I have 2023 50c) are more on the investing side, where monthlies are still “full casino” mode
Haha yah why didn’t I think of that, “just stop being poor”, it’s so easy!  🥴
Schrodinger's stimmy
Nah man, I been on since PIC near nav dawg . plus it's only been public for a few days soooo........
Thats a cheap ass old ass drug
Lmao whatever ur smoking is some good stuff
Are you using your entire margin? half? 25%?
yeah  when I looked at the options for 2023 that was what made be bite the bullet -- the 2023 UUP calls were like popcorn kernels, randomly up or down +/- 20% across the whole spectrum of strike prices  I took that to mean speculators are getting in now so if I get in now I can buy at low IV
I'm literally an idiot, not even joking - I'm new and seriously have no idea what I'm doing, but N G A already has a definitive agreement and merges in February. If N G A really is his play, I wonder what the catalyst would be that would drive N G A up. I also wonder why this catalyst isn't happening for a week or two, causing ComputerTE1996 to say he is waiting to post his DD because "Wsb retards have no patience \[and couldn't wait two weeks\]"
ENTIRE
[removed]
Bingo
Thanks man. I see it as an 800-1000 stock by Jan 2023. Betting accordingly
same
Interesting, will have to take a look at that, thanks.   I actually have a couple of UUP call options but expiring in Jan, was supposed to be a short term trade based on TA and price did what I expected it to do but it happened in the middle of the night and dumped by market open. First time trading UUP so wanted to see how it acts, had less than $20 in it.
perfect question surprised no one has talked about what to get your wife's boyfriend today
And full lockdown for the US until January 5th. THen after that market rises anotther percent to to close 4.5+ pn the day
Yeah same. Just a bit of good news for it and even if it recovered half of what it was and goes to like 30s, that’ll be nice profit for the both of us  And merry Christmas!
My mistake SAM
Thanks you too
Look at their investor presentation. Upcoming facility announcements, truck deliveries to Amazon, etc. So many coming dude, they will have a big Q1 2021
I have a conservative price target of $30 btw for N G A end of January/mid February. and that’s very very conservative
Keep going you’ll find it.  Not too common of a name - might help
I would not want to see that, but people get too comfortable. They stop working, stop helping, and then it is even harder to throw them out.
Post it with disclaimer .
you're crazy if you think the entire US will lock down, especially before Biden is inaugurated
Thank you autist
The evidence you give is convincing, and a $30+ PT by even 01/31 is very reasonable. That's great and I believe you.  I don't think that it's the ticker he's doing his DD on, though, for one reason: he calls it a risk-free, guaranteed three-bagger, *even without options.* Now it could be that he's talking about warrants (of which, as we know, he's very fond), but it looks to me like what he's saying is that *his price target is triple its current going rate.* I'm not sure of his time frame, of course, but even at a few months out, $55.20 seems *a little optimistic* — possible, but too optimistic to call it a *guaranteed three-bagger.* You get what I'm saying? What are your thoughts?
What do you retards do over the weekend to make money? I have a day job working from home and i simultaneously lose all my money making trades on the second monitor. What can i do on the weekends to make money? I get bored and i hate that i look forward to monday.
Fair point. Let’s see!
Nice lol haha
https://twitter.com/JStein_WaPo/status/1342642411822960640?s=19  If Trimp doesn't sign the bill then mass evictions and expiring benefits hits on Monday.  Fire Sale Monday morning, or sell if you're fully leveraged.
Zero chance lmao get real
You have a good track record, and I'm curious to see what your DD is on, but ain't shit guaranteed.
Boeing 737 max plane flown by air Canada emergency lands due to engine failure warning today.  Puts on BA?
Nope that sums it up
thanks ended even but it was a wild ride im used to around like 1-2 percent up or down in a day cause i usually use stocks but besides the days that i played gme and won hard acouple of days ago that was the fastest movement ive ever seen.
So you’re back huh? Why did you delete all your posts 😞 we still wanna laugh at you 🌈🐻
Good point. I reinstalled in my mid 2015 mbp  cuz had the itch to play and it was unplayable- 1 FPS in big team fights with all settings to lowest
I’d like to move on from my past 😘
Think Apple will hit 137 by 1/22?
Thanks bro
fuse
As long as it doesnt affect the individual calls I picked out spy could hit 340 for all I care
F, well the polls are close so fingers-crossed.  Crazy about the ADs maybe it's just your market?  Headlines are saying biggest Dem spending ever blah blah.  "totally exonerated" is hilarious hmm where have i heard that before.
I’d buy that dip
[removed]
First, this is a non-event. happens all the time  Second, it's a Rolls Royce engine issue more than Boeing's MCAS issue. I'd love to buy the dip if it panic sells for -1-2% on Monday
He’s trying to get more for Americans retard. Quit believing headlines they lie to control your brain
No he’s not. He’s trying to get attention because he’s a narcissist. If he cared he’d sign the bill and push a second payment. Everything he does is based on his narcissism bro.
this is not the first time Ali BABA is being investigated for monopolistic practices. Last time it was investigated for the same reasons it was fined $75,000 US (basically a slap on the wrist).

Hard to do that but I'll take a crack at explaining it a different way.  Compare the political situation right now to earlier this year. There was a time when protests were at peak levels of activity all over the world, driven by massive civil rights protests in the USA during an election year where the election and other tensions had the potential to kick off a civil war by winter.  During a period like that, what happens in the USA is Very important to the global power structure and they put focus on it. They prioritize the situation in the US more than usual, in terms of how much they think about it and just general resource allocation.  When the country you're in has some serious shit like that going on, you are in a chess game with the ruling class where they're a team and you're just a pawn. You have to compete with your fellow pawns as well as the enemy team because the enemy team is trying to take pawns and you want to be one that doesn't get taken. If you're smart this might be a good situation to be in and you might someday make it to the other side of the board and upgrade yourself from a pawn to one of the pieces that can really fight.  When your country is not being focused on, you're not in a chess game against the ruling class with real stakes, you're in a rock paper scissors game up against the other pawns and various pieces all simulating what a real chess game would be like. Since the ruling class aren't trying to maneuver intra-US capital in any particular way right this moment, capital in the US is being moved around with no real stakes. Instead of money being a means to an end, money is the means and the end. So you can't guess what people are going to try to do with money except try to make more money. You can't guess what big money is going to do next except try to be bigger and maybe fail who knows. Really just depends who guesses everyone else's next move right.  This isn't such a good position to be in as a smart person because now it's basically just rock paper scissors. Being smart gives you an advantage, but there's a lot of luck involved unless you limit yourself to only playing against predictable idiots.  Every day, people coordinate a plan for the market designed to trap people into certain trades, and then they look at what trades were made that day to decide the plan for the next day. Each day is a bull trap or a bear trap or a mix of both. If there are too many shorts and they're about to cause a squeeze at a time when it's unwanted, Trump can just tweet a tweet and fix it. If there are too many long positions being held overnight, instead of letting people exercise those calls and hold prices down they can just have the plan be a big dip that day to begin with to shake all those call holders out and move their assets into institutional holdings so the gains can't get anywhere outside the hands of the ruling class.  When the people coordinating the market are under plans to move certain things in certain directions - for example, when help is urgently needed moving capital to manipulate social media to prevent protesters from coordinating - smart traders can exploit these pressures to predict what the overnight plan for the market will be each day.  When all the ruling class are trying to do in your country is pull money out of it for shit they're trying to do in other countries, you lose those outside pressures to predict things by. That's another way of looking at how you get this transformation from a game of chess to rock paper scissors.   Right now, there's lots of protest movements and stuff with momentum in the East but the battle in the West has pretty much been won by the ruling class yet again for now by utilizing the right brainwashing narratives to keep the bipartisan horns locked. Since this conflict heat map happens to align along the east and west right now, it happens to also align the borders between the faux-capitalist hemisphere and the faux-communist hemisphere. So at a time like this, it's more important than usual to prop up faux-communism and less important than usual to prop up faux-capitalism. In fact it seems like they've decided it's worth it to take on some increased risk and instability in the west to strengthen faux-communism where it has a foothold in the East. Like, they're willing to keep the USD sliding no problem right now, among other issues being ignored for the time being. So we're even deeper in rock-paper-scissors territory than usual. Like, there's being on autopilot so the pilot can focus on communications, and then there's being on autopilot so the pilot can go take a shit in the back of the plane and snort some coke. That's how deep we are right now into no fucks given territory. If you notice the market seems retarded and nothing seems to matter, this is why.  -------------------  **Past this line I'm just speculating and not totally certain of my knowledge.**  I believe Putin is **the** global executive managing and coordinating governmental geopolitics for the ruling class and he has been for a long time. He holds that position with an iron fist and he's making things complicated because he wants to hold this exclusive utmost top spot in the world far past his time and so far he has the power to do so. Right now Navalny seems to be leading a charge by detractors to overthrow Putin and do a bit of cleaning house in the global power structure. Putin is just going ham against all detractors as usual, just facing a big charge right now.  Personally, I think they're planning on doing a big market correction and restructuring in the US soon. I'm not sure if they have a set time in mind for it or if they're just waiting until their hands are forced, in which case I'm not sure what will force their hand or when. If I had to guess I'd say we're very close though. Big societal turmoil coming for the US because they're tired of constantly having to micromanage the bipartisan narratives to keep the people's horns locked and they have some kind of ideas about how they can make this particular country less of a hassle for the foreseeable future. It's possible that we'd be in the middle of that chaos right now if it weren't for the fact that we got cucked so hard this year while Eurasia kept acting up, taking some focus off us. I'm not sure if the two different groups represented by Putin and Navalny differ very much in their plans for us, all I'm really sure of is that power struggle is both protecting us from chaos and causing our society to stagnate and fracture with a government in standby mode sleeping at the wheel.

Hey retard, it's up $16
Hey bud, how you doing? How’s your $2,000 check working out for you that Trump secured for you? 🤡 Looks like it was you who suddenly “STFU”.
What the fuck does the stimmy check have to do with people he’s pardoned? Yikes bro, big yikes
He pretended to want $2000 checks on the same day as his pardons. But he never actually wanted $2000 checks. Jesus Christ do I have to draw it out for you with crayons?
Holy shit you are actually a fucking sheep aren’t you? I don’t even like Mango and even I know he’s been advocating for more money for a long time.   I know this will be a shocker to your micro brain, but go ahead and take a look at all the presidential pardons that have happened in the past. There has been controversy with all of them. It’s part of the system whether you like it or not.
Hey clown. It’s his own party blocking it. If he actually wanted it he would have been demanding it this entire time. Instead he played golf every day during the negotiations then made his “demands” after the negotiations were over, and then signed the other bill. The whole thing was political theater to manipulate the very dumbest among us. And it clearly worked, because here you are, confused by the whole thing.

Dude, hope you haven't roped. Have you actually gained any money this week? I hope you haven't YOLOd into something retarded this week. I doubled my money from 0tde last Friday and a +120% 0tde today (both bought and sold within 5mins today). If I was you and yoloding 12k I'd be rich. Let me know
Nah down 20k in a month, not much money or income now maybe it’s a sign to stop fucking gambling
Maybe if you got 10k buy some TSLA just before close Thursday. I've made 110% doing that past two weeks and I'm an idiot
