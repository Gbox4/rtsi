Does working on Christmas count?
Gme gonna make sure we have money for presents
Yes, and true
Oh no. I just got back from getting T/O from subway on base here in Germany and the guys behind me were talking about PLUG, LAZR, and QS. This is literally the top. These guy are probably 19 and been in military for a coup of months.  The one guy said QS is the next Tesla. üòÄüòÄüòÄ You literally can‚Äôt make this up.
Alright looks like QS is dead , and my calls are super dead
I would like to submit my application for wsb mod.

I guess it's better than buying a Mustang/Camaro at a 24% interest rate
GME to $35 today. My DD? My dick hurts.
 GME finally moving
GME not updating  for anyone else? What's going on here? Limit up?
I would trust cathie with my life.........savings
I think you meant 28
Up 3%
sell low buy high
An almost obsolete company went from 15 to 22 within two days. That was the squeeze. Of course, there may be more in the future, but are you guys seriously expecting KODK levels of ridiculousness?
How does that distinguish you from the rest of us?
**I CALL THIS THE GME CYCLE**  GME has a 20% week, posts flood this subreddit, kids are screaming the squeeze is happening! the squeeze is happening!.  Few days later, GME reverts back down 10-20% but usually makes a higher low.   All the GME posts dissapear, kids come here calling it a pump and dump! Is Ths SquEEzE sTILL hAPPEninG/??? Im lOSing All MY moNey On 50% oTm WeekeLIes  All the retards lose their money..  Gme moons past its 20% week to a higher high and the posts come back, everyone saying nows the time...  Literally like clockwork since september. Its actually hilarious at this point
During a pandemic? I thought that was the point
BABA black sheep   Have you any wool?      Yes Sir, yes Sir   Three bags full

You have my vote.
it has 600 pre market volume lol. no one is trading it right now
So QS with no actual product is the second most valuable auto stock (TSLA is the first) in US? Someone help me understand
Dear Santa, all I want for Christmas is the GME short squeeze.  Oh, and if the elves could finish tinkering with the 2k stimmy that would sure be swell. Thanks!
My RH is not updating anything. Anyone else having this problem

Volatility look more useful to me right now than waiting for TSLA to break a new high like I usually did. An ancient gaming retailer is a weird choice though, but money doesn't care. Will buy the next 15% dip.
Approved
Gotta woo the dependapotamuses somehow!
never ever
What sector do we rotate into today? Last week it has been a bit of meme stocks and green stocks
Jesus, what a year. If it weren't for the stock market and this sub, I'd probably be addicted to heroin by now.  Thanks retards... you're like one big, dysfunctional, surrogate family.
For the love of gos, its down 20$!!!
sell the rip buy the dips and hold some leaps. gme has followed the same formula for the last year and a half. not stoppin now
I will never invest in China ever again.   Indian is my next target for growth.

Yea I hate that, it stops on PC too.
Hmm, gonna need to find a bigger stick to poke it with then.

50% of my portfolio is now $ARKK and $ICLN. Got some LEAPS left in $PLTR that I'm selling CCs on.  Got some $DM and $MT lotto tickets and the last bit is 100% $EVER calls. I told everyone about $LMND a few weeks ago but even I paper handed a potential 20 bagger into just a 5 bagger.  Not making that mistake again, $EVER 50 EOY
Nice one bro you totally owned him
Get in $EVER tody. Gonna be a repeat of LMND.
I never see anyone mention ENPH. Shits basically a 2nd tesla. I remember trading it at $30 last year. Damn.
U only lose money when you sale
Alright fuck it, I've gotten trapped many a times on BABA, first at 270 and then at 260 everytime going out with a loss but I'm sure this time will be different ü§°
The dollar is an absolute joke right now, Jesus fucking Christ.  There's literally no point buying US equities right now from the UK, I purchased some a few days ago and I literally need about a 5% return just let break even. Fuck's sake.
Someone buy those 18 GME shares at 23.50
Is TSLA a boomer stonk now?
I take that back. I was trading it at $14. God damn
Why not much longer? Microvast is a crusher.
bruh i sold for a loss when it went from 50--&gt; 40 thinking the fraud was real
They also said no sales or revenue for 5 years lmao
yes its very annoying.... Hoping it will regain value in the next year or so, just gota keep your money in USD to realise more gains
Lol I feel bad for OP, I feel bad for myself, but you're not wrong.
Why are there so many singular trades of literally 1 or 2 shares that get spammed after-hours/pre-market? Who the hell buys and sells one share of a $9 stock to begin with, but especially why are so many trades executed of it AH/PM? Is it just ppl trying to set the stock price where they want it?
It doesn't moon fast enough for people here. But it's kinda like SQ, just goes up and up and up.
Damn who wouldve thought puts on Baba before eod yesterday would print bigly. Tf Baba
I used to own 2k shares at $18. Sold it at $18... üôÇ
BABA pleas fly again
TAN is where it‚Äôs at
Fuckk feelsbad
are we buying this baba dip?
Having products and earnings is bearish in this market son
When is solar week on retardstreetbets?
Hey, calls may be the play at open. Might buy some fd lottos for the fuck of it
Y‚Äôall remember back a few months ago when ENPH was being investigated? Lol we had puts printing and shit and it drilled to $35, then fucking overnight all the mfers bought the dip and it opened up like 6% next day and wiped out all gains.
Yeah if Tech could dump that would be great. Also if you guys could have those TPS report on my desk by the end of the day that would also be great.
PLTR it's time to fly once again
Where do you live so I can go slap you for such blasphemy!!
Partial limit orders getting filled and bots
I think I will have to buy the dip for the fifth time. It's sad, but what choice do I have. Give up?
apple is back to being boomer i see. glad i sold all my positiosn except 1 call lol
Why is it so hard to just make 4k in a week. I swear I'll quit after that..
Good thing I start buying around August, if you had EUR or GBP exchanged to USD at the beginning of the year and you're already not doing hot on the returns.... GUH
GBP is historically very weak... after Brexit it could strengthen a hell of a lot more than this, watch out
CRM tear-based lube circle jerk meeting starts in 20 mins. My place
I am not touching that chinese shiet anymore, I am leave 15 260 mar fuking calls that cost me more than 14k! Not avg down, not selling
Can you shill me on EVER
It sucks, been thinking about putting money into a broker like tastytrade to get options access but if I do it'll probably be a 10% loss by default at the rate the dollar is tanking. Then again I have been trading us stocks so I'm allready taking the loss anyway, and getting double fked because my local broker charges like 8 dollars a trade so.....
Hi GOEV, pleas fly again
with that attitude youll never make 4k in a week lol
$AAPL is EV stock now. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
Shill would imply I know what I'm talking about.
I'd give anything to go back to early March and replay everything again and fix my massive mistake which was buying TSLA puts. I'd be a god damn millionaire right now had I just bought calls instead
It‚Äôs not too late to get on the Triterras bandwagon.  Merry Christmas!
I went all in two days ago
Sorry to hear
lol i would not touch it. not sure how much i will fall
Best day to plant a tree was yesterday. Second best day is today.

Lmao because they‚Äôre going to start *production* in 2024? I‚Äôd rather gamble away everything on VGAC
From 8/24 to 10/26 I went from +31% to -56%. How‚Äôs that work?   As an additional bonus: From 10/26 to today I went from -56% to +24%.
So, I got about 10k to spare on same day options. What‚Äôs on your mind

I'm a buyer of USD right now  buy low sell high  no one can time the bottom with 100% accuracy
you have my vote then
Wait you *don‚Äôt* want to get in on a SPAC before it moons?
As an American I didn't realize this at all. Scary because I kinda want to buy puts to hold over Christmas weekend but if what my spidey sense detects happening that weekend is a collapse of the dollar then puts might not even be good since the value crash might not be reflected in dollars

Why did you guys stay up to watch the paint dry
If GME closes above 23.5 I will buy 3 people on this sub copies of 13 sentinels (from Gamestop of course). Only the smartest video games for the smartest bestest people on the internet.
No
Don't worry. We'll be at high teens early next year. This was never supposed to be a day trade. Stay comfy and know you did the right thing.
Stilling holding Mara should I be worried about a crash?
I watched few episodes. Was nice.
They were probably used games that other people returned for store credit without the case

I know, I gotta pump those numbers up.
Sadly not to the chinese kids, they were abandoned by their BABA üò≠
Wow, BABA super cheap. Gonna add those bargains to my Wirecard and Nikola stocks.
At the same time, the us market is the place if you want to trade options
Tesla will never be a boomer stock
It‚Äôs funny, I tried talking to real people about electric vehicles and they were like ‚Äúda fuck you talking about dumbass, that‚Äôs like 20 years in the future!! We don‚Äôt even have gas stations in some parts!‚Äù  Then I remembered EVs are only a thing here

"should I be worried"  a question that doesn't inspire confidence  I don't hold investments that I'm not confident about

Just happened for me a couple days ago after being locked all year. Been playing with the less than $100 in my account and made $12 on a $50 RAD call just to prove to myself I can do better than I used to before I transfer in the $1000 I've got coming to invest. Be careful friend, "slow and steady" wins the race (but really, accepting 20% gains overnight instead of constantly chasing ten-baggers is still fucking fast not quite "slow and steady")
Check out the latest Canoo vehicle release video, the compare it to the Apple M1 release video. They are super similar in styles. I could definitely see an Apple/ Canoo partnership... üöÄ

China is going to zero.
Yes
They‚Äôre both based in California and Canoo already have a B2B partnership with Hyundai where they stick a chassis on Canoo ‚Äúskateboards‚Äù. This makes so much sense for Apple.

If it‚Äôs Option 2 I will suck my own dick while calling out your name.
the chad strat:  skim the daily thread and look for retards who are insecure about their positions and inverse them
Gobble gobble
Option 3: MMs bait us with movement on all our meme stocks, sell us a bunch of FDs that are worthless by EOD  Everyone loses, theta gang eats popcorn on the sidelines
I am very bullish for the year end. All the retards will get cash and checks from their families for Christmas and pile them into stonks and call options - we will be taken to new heights. May create a hangover in January though

Sounds like ur about to found a startup

How much money can we YOLO?    To the unemployment line!   To flipping burgers at Wendy‚Äôs!   Now gamble away! Gamble away!   Gamble away all your tendies!

i'm kind of similar in that way i guess, i tend to play devil's advocate without really taking a stance or side, but i don't think people take me less seriously because of it. rather they tend to just ask questions rather than engaging. and then i look like an idiot because apparently i can't actually come up with an original thought, i can only argue with others

Ask around for  a good Doctor of PT in your area. I used to go every 2 weeks to the chiro. My GP referred me to a PT and I'm 100x better. I  t does cost more, but now I go in once a month for a sports massage. It's the most painful hour of the month but I feel like a million bucks afterwards.  I hope you get some relief though. Chronic pain really is no joke. Painkillers are addictive on their own, but now that I'm a little older, I can only imagine how addictive living pain free is.

There is no use of talking about Winnie the Pooh. He is always power hungry and will be power hungry. This jokema made jokes on Chinese banks. The result is waking up Winnie the Pooh dark mode.

Whats the play on BABA? It has literally dipped back to what it was in May-June and most likely all the news on investigation might just end with a few new rules. Tired of buying dips on it for over a month now. Thing of going heavy on leaps if it stays red for 2 days.
How often do you mean by a lot?
It‚Äôll probably hit $20 by then. Current price is a bargain imo
How we feeling about PLTR today, boys?
It‚Äôs very likely btwn. Needed to buy a few weeks ago probably too late now unless deal is announced

Was thinking about buying today at market open but it's up 23% since yesterday. I'm gonna wait for it to drop.
Buy the rumor. Currently up 20ish% since yesterday morning.   I usually buy stocks and sell once I hit +20%/-8% so this was a good play
You are a good man. Have a snek
Their stock price history doesn't engender confidence, why the spikes and sell offs?
This is what we've been seeing a lot over the last weeks, the strikes did trend up. Last week it was pinned at 27 and week before that 25-26.   Seems like progress.

Definitely buying leaps and shares on this Baba dip.
I initially shorted the 40c, 35c, 30c, and now 28 (I was catching PLTR as it was falling to hedge my long position). The 28c but still has a ton of extrinsic value. Also, since my spread is set up properly, I don't mind (though may not *want)* hitting my max profit. Can easily just re-enter the position with new spreads (can widen or tighten as needed).   On 1/8 if PLTR is still trading around $28 or so, I can most likely roll up and out for a credit, thus getting paid to wait a bit longer to collect more profit.
Why the fuck am I killing myself working in finance when girls on social media and only fans make triple what I earn
I ruined my first account on December 24, 2018 during a Christmas massacre day we dropped like 1,000 points on DOW that day.
Yeah good reminder.
that seems like an issue with the people though, not necessarily the nature of political discussion.  i've always hated the politics ban on this sub. ban political posts sure but it should be allowed in discussion threads specifically, it's just too relevant to disallow. not talking about political shilling of course
And that‚Äôs what you think America has?  Lol
Is it always better to buy eod vs start?
Same, breh. I'm actually not tired rn so it shouldn't be too bad. Some days I'm half asleep until almost market close lmao.
I toured the new World Equestrian Center last night.  Not a penny was spared on the venue. Feels like someone from Disney or The Villages came up and built it.   Attention to detail was impeccable; neither my wife or I have ever been to such a nice Equestrian Venue. Wellington, Rolex, etc, have absolutely nothing compared to WEC.  Calls on a K Shaped recovery! Get on board, in this case, if you're not first, you really will be last.

You don‚Äôt criticize the leader of China and get away with it if you‚Äôre Chinese. I wouldn‚Äôt touch BABA with a pole personally. I went to Beijing in February. Four or five cameras stacked on top of each other on every street corner all pointed directly at your face. Very dehumanizing. China does not fuck around.
Last year and a half has been an anomaly. It's not guarantee it will keep same pace in 2021.

Your logic is undeniable
So glad I got out of BABA.

It means current price action is meaningless so far, if about 1.000.000 shorts must cover today.

Its doing coo too. Respect
This hell hole sure as hell isn‚Äôt the world either, that‚Äôs not the point. You just said it, most car manufacturers are invested on it sure, but your regular Joe who lives and works 8/5, saves the bare minimum and drives a Toyota doesn‚Äôt know shit about electric vehicles
Yes!
Just buy the underlying stocks they are listed

I agree, fuck the CCP
Anyone lucky enough to be holding baba puts?
I would argue it takes money to make money, and you don‚Äôt get money by always starting over at 0%.
I see so the price doesn‚Äôt reflect much yet. So if they have to cover gme could surge today no?
a shitty dell one, what should i be looking for?

Baba calls...
Of course the nature of political debates depends on personality of participants, but there are certain human traits which are very predictable.  Political discussions, especially when it‚Äôs about a polarizing person like Trump will lead to nowhere.   Political posts are definitely allowed on discussion threads. Just saw a huge discussion ( read name-calling) about Trump veto of stimulus and spending bill.
i would argue i'll kick your fuckin ass

Hilarious you think you have more money than boomers. The entire political apparatus has been setup to funnel money from the young to the old. See student loans, see social security, see tenured professors, see defined pension plans that no longer exist for the young but still have to be paid for by them, etc etc.

yeah i guess that's true and i'm arguing for the way i think things should be rather than the way that they are.  and it seems hit or miss in the discussion threads. i got suspended once for making fun of the big thing at the DNC about biden's stutter but i've also gotten away with more blatantly political stuff so idk, seems like it's not as heavily moderated but you might get busted
I‚Äôm guessing it was ultimately paid for by tax payers, like our football stadiums?
That's bad bro. Let me give you a more extreme example. 1 share has been sold for a total of $20. His saying there is no volume, you don't know the price until there is volume.

Good. Fuck you for investing in communism.
I will never forget December 24, 2018. I was just approved for options and went all in on calls.   We had one of the largest crashes in years that day. Ruined my first account that way.

I see 50 comments in a row saying ‚Äúbuy baba‚Äù and I check on that flaming pile and it is down NINE PERCENT in the PM?!  Imma go read why, but y‚Äôall high on crack if you are buying calls on that atm.
and Cathie is life
I would invest, I imagine they are profiting a ton from this sell off
You can build your career. They have what‚Äôs known in finance as a ‚Äúdepreciating asset‚Äù.
Who is getting into BABA next week?
You ain‚Äôt shillin hard enough son
Which call ?
I got it at like 11pm. Had dreams all night it went to $40 before I could buy.
$IPOC calls on the dip.
Right I got that part.. but about the 1 million shorts needing to cover today, that could drive the price up
Only thing we dumpin is loads in ur mum
Glad that BABA takes all of the attention today. Buy calls!
When is SPCE taking off
50?!? Come on. That‚Äôs no less than a $100 stock!
Yeah what's new about that
QS calls
I came this morning to say XL moonshot incoming
I'm not able to do options, so the question is,   I'm currently $500 into tesla, and $500 into MT.  Is it too late to hit GME?  I'm yet to be diagnosed as a retard so I just want to get going with decent profit by learning.  I have about $3500 in a 5% month gain fund so 1k is my play money.

This why I don‚Äôt like to invest in Chinese companies. I screwed myself with LI and still holding that bag
Those and people with money care about it. It's not only the market who will decide if electric vehicles will succeed. Govt policies are also changing to enforce climate change conscious manufacturing. California is planning to ban sale of gas powered vehicles by 2035. UK by 2025. The average Joe will be forced to get an electric even if he doesn't give a shit about it
I think you fell for that hedge fund manager end of year manipulation crap, steel ain‚Äôt going anywhere for a while, you might just as well hold. My take is that there will be a dip until the government announces infra modernization investments

Reinfections are common given the opportunity [[1]](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/khsw6u/scientists_urge_concern_not_alarm_over_new_virus/ggo8qir/). Reinfections can be used to estimate anti-body half life for anti-bodies created by the vaccine. [[2]](https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/antibody+half-life). Reinfections can also be used as an indicator for B cell immunity, as B cell immunity created via a infection is the same as B cell immunity created by a vaccine. [[3]](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html). Yes, vaccines do provide a greater initial antibody count than a natural infection, but the anti-body half life is the same and short as indicated by reinfections. Bi-annual vaccine boosters are not logistically feasible.  If antigenic drift reduces efficacy rapidly, its a problem. Its not possible to vaccinate for multiple versions bi-annually. [[4]](https://twitter.com/trvrb/status/1340409968818671616?s=20).

I tried to deposit a DoorDash gift card last week and it didn‚Äôt work sadly. It‚Äôs basically cash so I don‚Äôt get the problem
So buy the BABA dip or what
I agree with the Texas Roadhouse sentiment. Definitely the best lower cost steak chain restaurant!  The gift card is for Longhorns, Olive Garden, Cheddars, Bahama Breeze, Seasons 52, and Yardhouse. I can cook better steaks and make better Italian food. Maybe I‚Äôll get Cheddars as I don‚Äôt know what the last three are at all.

I‚Äôll reply again since you deleted your post or got deleted:  ‚ÄúAll this said, I'm not concerned that these variants will significantly reduce vaccine efficacy in the 2021 rollout. Most circulating SARS-CoV-2 viruses do not have any mutations in the spike receptor binding domain‚Äù  ‚ÄúHowever, we may see modest reductions in vaccine efficacy due to antigenic drift and will likely need a process in the coming years by which we update the spike variant used in the vaccine to best match circulating viruses.‚Äù  From your source.

Absolutely will not happen imo, the uncertainty and lack of preparation/information is what crashed the markets in March.

If you aren't making money off chinese markets and taking a small part of their GDP for over here, the communists have won. Don't let the uyghurs die for nothing. Do your part by stealing chinese money for our use.

YO WHY THE FUCK ARE WE NOT HEARING ABOUT ANTIBODY TESTS   30%+ of the pop already had covid if you look at recent studies and take time into account   We don‚Äôt know if having vid makes you immune (but most viruses that are beaten by the immune system create some immunity response so probably) but what the fuck I want to know if I have had it and I think this is pretty pertinent info, they can detect the antibodies in blood with great accuracy now so what the fuck is this, I wanna know if I had the vid shouldn‚Äôt be some guessing game and why now news on this fucking eh

stop thinking that having diamond hands makes you a badass ... just cut the loss now before it grows and move your money into something smarter
Baba is safe, Jack Ma on other hand..
CCP: What a run the past month for all. But as traders looking for short exposure, $BABA is no longer a stock but a full casino. Does not take a ball of crystal to know this will fall back to Arda. Shorting with a $200 2020 target
I‚Äôve been saying this... people need to be getting the antibody test, not the Covid test, prior to doing their holiday travels

I never had covid nor had symptoms and my ab test was neg yesterday
Bruh. In kaladesh‚Äôs inventors fair, they confiscate the winning prize, a planear portal. Only thing is, u can‚Äôt send non living things thru the portal.
If you‚Äôre up pretty big then go back to making the level of trades you started with.  As you make more money you usually risk more with every trade. You won‚Äôt get rich quick but you‚Äôll at least not be stagnant.
Every dollar up GME moves is $10k from my calls. Let‚Äôs GOOOOoOoOoOio

If BABA actually opens around 230 I may be forced to buy the fucking dip
Harry is not loyal? üò±
Cleared the dirty dishes out of my room, loaded the washer &amp; cleaned the sink, got some laundry done and did 100 push-ups  It must be the holiday spirit or something but it feels way better to wake up and get something done before open (6:30 in Cali)
Exactly
Thank you, and merry Christmas to you!  I'm really excited about the growth potential of the area. Between WEC, we also have new warehouses from Amazon, chewy, FedEx, autozone.  Ocala is already home to the largest custom firetruck factory in the world, the largest medical marijuana farm in the state, and our Sheriff made INTERNATIONAL headlines by refusing to let his officers wear masks.  Lot of poor people here that may be lifted out of poverty.
Literally bought both last week, no shame!
And moved the money into something else that‚Äôs moving. Something to be said about dead money. If he sold Airlines at the bottom in April/May and dumped it all in TSLA, then what?
Average down on baba calls ?
Damn Baba just keeps getting destroyed. Should have bought puts when it was in the 300s.
Puts on BABA at open?
After I fucking sell after holding for 6 moths of course
Maybe. I still think the squeeze isn‚Äôt happening yet and that it‚Äôll retract some, then flatten for a while. IV is insane right now, so FDs are still pretty expensive.   FWIW, I bought 12/24 $15.50c on Monday for $0.55 when GME was trading around $15.00 (and then sold on Tuesday for $3.00...not a big bet, just 10).
Not really.
Thanks for this, I‚Äôm selling my calls at open and gonna buy back eoy
Stap makin soft things hard.
But if you can't send living things through, how tf is Vorinclex there?
Who cares? You‚Äôd get your BABA shares split into 3 companies   as well.

I think the 6th of jan. You can double check [here](https://spactrack.net/)
No fucking clue.
Sounds good, thanks!
People that are thinking of buying BABA calls rn were the kids that stuck forks in electrical outlets when they were expressly warned not to

Depends on how much you got and how far out the calls are. Tbh I might not average down unless I held a leap, this could be bad for awhile.  I‚Äôm sorry bro I hope it works out for you

Today will be a 5.5 hour power hour where the market rips.  Christmas is tomorrow, which is the most bullish holiday of the year.  2021 is around the corner and all the homies are gonna want to get into their positions before that face ripper of a year starts.  Also we‚Äôre getting unlimited stimmy.  Finally, stonks have been not going up the past couple days so we gotta make up for that today.
I was joking lol
Well of course if I buy puts it will go up. If I wanted to prove my point I‚Äôd have to buy calls.

Merry Christmas everyone of you cucks.

Short baba or long GME? Asking for a yolo
If you don‚Äôt need the money, just hold BABA. This will pass. BABA has a competent management and right now tensions are just high. If you don‚Äôt need it, just pretend you don‚Äôt have it. I know it hurts to look at, but look at every major dip, what is the one thing that has always happened after each dip?
I mean, fundamentally it actually is

That‚Äôs the risk you take. Everything is what if. If you want a huge thrill with high risk high reward, this is the chance. True WSB degens are buying baba leap calls today.
You get taxed on income, your employer also has to pay tax on your wages. You take some of you income to put in the market to make some extra cash, that gets taxed too if you make anything. You buy a house and have to pay property taxes for as long as you own it. One day you build up a nice savings and pass it on to your children/family, that‚Äôs taxed too. You can‚Äôt escape taxes.

Been holding 300p 1/8 since the last lockup expiry. Def fucked up getting in so early, but was able to average down nicely when it spiked up to 357 on Tuesday. They needed to keep it propped up until this next lockup expiry but the gloves are coming off next week.
My guess? Baba news dragging it down
That would have made no sense. This drop in no way reflects their ability as a company. They are worth over a trillion. It‚Äôs just unlucky it‚Äôs a Chinese company.

Can't the stock market just outsource all of these holidays to India?
No, they won‚Äôt allow BABA to fail. It‚Äôs the closet thing to AMZN they have, and China wouldn‚Äôt give up such a huge foothold to international markets for whatever is going on...it would be an irrational decision. You do you, but BABA is a solid company, especially if you don‚Äôt care to hold for years. I wouldn‚Äôt average in (at least not now), but no point selling at a loss
Yeah I have been able to!
If the threat of being delisted in America didn't do much to it, it should be fine over this BABA thing. It does make me reconsider investing in Chinese companies, though. As if there wasn't reason enough already.

Yo what if Xi and Jack are Lowkey best friends and they just shaking out all American paper hands so they can get cheaper shares before BABA literally sells the Chinese every item ever.
i might buy BABA though after that long speech. if i get it at 200$ ill go in for sure

Do we think the market sells off at open?
My two cents on BABA and you can buy/sell/wank whatever with it.  What makes you think someone like the CPP who doesn‚Äôt give a fuck about violating global human rights laws, has thousands of fraudulent companies using US patents, and promotes mass censorship gives a flying fuck about a company like Alibaba being successful if their CEO forgets what hood he‚Äôs in.  What we‚Äôre going to see is a literal example being made of Jack Ma. They‚Äôre going to ensure that future CEOs of companies like JD or NIO won‚Äôt forget who‚Äôs really in charge, or so help them God, the CCP will make sure their companies fail and they‚Äôll lose some non-vital organs to boot.  Fuck Xi, fuck the CCP, fuck their dictatorship, all in NIO leaps

Anybody cash out their BABA puts yesterday?  how ya feeling?
This profit taken is an ancient art
Warrants are currently trading at a discount, but it stays that way as SPACs moon. Just make a decision and buy a ton. I have a ton of both, planning on adding warrants on every dip
Has GME changed their business model at all? Just curious
Jack Ma has to feel so emasculated rn. Imagine being that rich but powerless.
You right, you right. ‚ÄúIt was priced in‚Äù is what I cry myself to sleep thinking about my expired 39 PFE calls.

When do we buy baba calls?
What do u mean?
Don‚Äôt really give a shit about BABA but for anyone w/ NIO just chill out. This has nothing whatsoever to do with them and every single thing China-related right now is just taking a premarket hit.
Edibles are the way. You don't feel as bad and you eat more.
Cool go get an antibody test with your own money then. It‚Äôs for your peace of mind and unnecessary. Vaccine will be free or cheap and an antibody test is for your peace of mind only. I‚Äôm sure they are doing studies but that doesn‚Äôt make the vaccine any less important

Reverse splits are bad. Usually show that a company isn‚Äôt doing well.

Not only do I own BABA options, but JD options. That's what kills me. They are Feb, but I don't need this uncertainty. Trying to keep emotions out of it right now

Short interest is higher than ever, and based on much lower cost of shares. The squeeze hasn't even started
Not wheeling the naked puts. Using naked puts to get assigned the position and then start wheeling. I'll just keep selling naked puts until it pulls back, I get assigned, then use those shares to start wheeling.
I have a good feeling after yesterday‚Äôs performance

This year has taught me to stop doubting my vibe, called the rises of GRWG, QS, FUBO, ICLN and few others and also timed PLTR's top. Only problem is I'm too retarded to hold (except ICLN). I've dodged out of market dips pretty well and my worst play was FOMO'ing into TSLA this past Monday. Gonna try to to keep listening to myself and hold. MCFE 1/15 $20c
baba poohts are free money
It won‚Äôt be better by February
I hope GME moons for you guys but if it can drill and go negative at open like yesterday so I can unload these 21p's that'd be nice

Dude sentiment with baba right now is very negative I would not buy it. A lot of big money put buying over the last couple weeks. But Im retarded so
No

Look out we have a badass over here
Funny how rapidly sentiment changes. When BABA was flying at 300/share in anticipation for the ANT ipo, it was an amazing buy, great fundamentals, going to be the Chinese amazon and rocket.   Now that it‚Äôs sitting at being almost negative YTD and down 30% from its top, it‚Äôs a shit Chinese scam stock and will bankrupt you, even if you go long
How stupid are my WFC leaps

It's funny, USA or EU launch antitrust or monopoly shit at AMZN, APPLE, FB, GOOG and they falter 1-2% on a bad day..       BABA gets in the cross hairs and gets fucking mutilated.
If u wanna buy baba don't buy right away I feel this shit may tank more after a small bounce
Actually all the cheap shit people bought of AMZN came from BABA. She‚Äôll be back.
Just because Ma insulted everyone over there. Literally wouldve been fine if he hadnt started getting full of himself

Trump has not signed the bill. He might pocket veto it (aka not sign it by Monday, letting it expire) to pressure McConnell to pass 2k stimulus check.
Who knew the Backstreet Boys were singing about the stock market?  **BABA-BYE**
There's some Chinese American guy reading this and there's some Chinese equivalent to twitter where he follows Xi Jinping and he's making bank going along with Xi doing insider trading based on Xi's subtle telegraphing of his upcoming moves. This week is gonna be a solid 40-bagger for the man I'm speaking of but he won't share any of it with us. He's not telling us about this Chinese Twitter equivalent and giving us translations of little things Xi says. Why not? I ask you, mysterious Chinese lurker, why do you selfishly lurk and refuse to participate? I would give you my retarded advice if I thought it could help you, why won't you give us yours?
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre still working in it, maybe we‚Äôll do something about it eventually idk lol‚Äù

Good dip coming up for NIO for that parabolic run next week

I agree, but even the slightest possibility of spillover is giving me a headache.
This song goes out to all the BABA call holders.   Love is a burning thing And it makes a fiery ring Bound by wild desire I fell into a ring of fire I fell into a burning ring of fire I went down, down, down and the flames went higher And it burns, burns, burns, the ring of fire The ring of fire

Baba, and all other businesses in China, exist only as long as the whims of the entirely unaccountable government allow them to. In America the megacaps own the government. In China it is the exact opposite.
BABA 300 EOD from China Street pumping the fuck out of this.

They bought back intels stake in them
I mean to be fair, that mall was busy enough that even a guy from CNBC was there. Legitimately noteworthy
It was out yesterday, were you in a coma?
Penny stocks are shares traded under 5 bucks with a low market cap. You're thinking of just a small cap stock. Commonly misunderstood
Ok so the GME short squeeze is real. Has anyone considered what might happen afterwards? I mean, GME is still a piece of shit. What's actually gonna happen when the squeeze is over?
Trump said the bill contains too much wasteful spending, and the wasteful spending should be given to the American people instead, which is why he recommends $2000 instead of 600. The bureaucrats take that as, $2000,+$600, +the wasteful spending. Insanity. They‚Äôve been pulling shit like that since Nixon was president, and Milton Friedman proposed the negative income tax... TO REPLACE welfare. What ends up happening, congress votes to add a negative income tax to all the existing welfare, and the support fell apart. Guess what‚Äôs going to happen with this stimulus? Same shit.
You are a fucking tard if you buy Baba at open
I am
GME squeeze time
The best set up. No splitting time or families getting jealous. Get yourselves a Latin lover boys lol
I vote bullish on low volume
I will literally be so happy when GME dies  Just so I don‚Äôt have to see the letters GME between every 5 fucking words that I read on here
Let‚Äôs go

His point is that you can‚Äôt be assigned with naked puts- you don‚Äôt have the cash to buy the shares by definition. You probably mean cash secured puts?
He gave a speech critical of Chinese government regulators and banks. So they fucking ruined him
Let‚Äôs be clear the Republicans are saying it‚Äôs wasteful.  Trump may as well have kicked them in the nuts.  If they tank the bill now they‚Äôre probably not going to win the senate in Georgia.
I have $100 on Webull that I completely forgot about because I don‚Äôt use the app. What calls should I buy with it?
It drops sharply back down to support. I don‚Äôt see it going back below $18 after the real squeeze though.
The monthly job report is reported on the first Friday of every month. Then there is also weekly jobless claims reported every Wednesday at morning

Jerking off too BABA loss porn would be like jerking off to my own dick pic. Feels bad man.
Man I truly feel bad for BABA call holders
My girlfriend said she's been having dreams about Bears and knows absolutely nothing about the bears/bull stuff except that bears are gay.  What does this mean.
You buy puts and ill buy calls and we will see who does better
Any news on when the Apex merger will happen?
FDX, $30 off on great earnings and news with vaccine distribution and Walmart
Come on you probably just saved like 50 lurkers who read the last sentence of your comment
Today Im taking RKT off my watch list. Straight cuk of a company
Damn rip Baba
PLTR cucking begins
Gyna ate your lunch
IMO, wouldn't buy calls for anything until next week or the new year, could be a lot more profit taking/rebalancing.  Remember that massive selloff of Dec 2018?
Regular income tax. With deduction and shit, the effective rate should be around 20% so 20k-25k
Turn on the printers bois
Oh shoot I bought LGVW with that 100 when I opened the account, might as well just turn that into calls once they‚Äôre available ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
You must hate pltr then
Normally the stock dumps. Look at ostk 1 year chart
200.
Going all in on T calls because I'm retarded
Ah I gotcha. It's a CSP, I just wasn't thinking
apparently not I just got murdered for suggesting this
srne* but yeah i may sell soon
Underrated comment
Stic
Baba. The only stock actually undervalued based on fundamentals and look what is happening to it. Stocks with no fundamentals (hello QS) to the moon. This market ü§°
I‚Äôm afraid it‚Äôll be another situation like Luckin Coffee earlier this year where it went up to around $50 quickly then fall to almost nothing even faster after an a similar antitrust allegation
I‚Äôm a man of the people. In conclusion, BABA 300 EOD
Haha awesome brother. Made me smile especially bc I'm going to be spending Christmas alone.... cheers from SE Michigan.
GME please go above 22
LOL, you know you can lookup how many shares are shorted right?
Went there yesterday. Current business model is terrible and they are more expensive than competitors locally. If it ‚Äúsqueezes‚Äù it will go back to penny stock eventually. Shit company
Are Baba calls the move?
Be successful
502 boi
BRB, my other gf knows more about dream interpretation than gf 1...
The CCP ain‚Äôt the DOJ dawg. The CCP is made up of competing families who want a piece of Jack‚Äôs pie. I‚Äôm not touching Baba for a while.
All BABA calls just became FD's expiring today
BSBR is up 80% last 3 months - so calls on BSBR?
He is probably so hard rn
The spending is wasteful, billions of dollars go to other countries. 900B to send out $600 checks which cost 200b. So where‚Äôs the other $2400?
So let me interpret this.  If your sole income was the $100k then you would pay the 28%, correct?  If in conjunction to the $100k you also have a high net worth job, then we are looking at the 40%...
Wait for it to stabilize. Dont buy a leap on a huge down day, IV is going to be high as fuck
I‚Äôm waiting for that shit to DUMP at open
NOBODY MOVE!
They‚Äôre not going to do shit  I have 12 shades of baba at 283 so I‚Äôm kind of hoping the blood bath ends lol
Will spy get to 370 today?
I‚Äôm glad you unAmerican traitors are getting burned rn, this is WallStreetBets, not GreatWallBets üò§
If you told me 6 months ago that the Russell 2000 would end up being a better trade than Chadsdaq I would have laughed.
BUY NGA IF U LIKE MONEY  FCEL TOO
Lol. GME actually went up. Still if you gave me $100, I'd put it in a penny stock.
Thankfully I'm already down 50% on my BABA position. Can't go down that much more!
Sell all your positions that are down money to offset your gains
hey, my gf said the same thing...
Yeah, the efficient market holds true
I just told my boomer uncle   To go fuck himself for telling me to put my   Money in a index fund and retire care free at 65 years of age  ‚Äú WHY ARE THESE FUCKERS CONFIDENT THEY WILL LIVE THAT LONG‚Äù   The fuck unless Cathy ark is right about Genome edit therapy. Bitch 40 years of age is the peak before it goes DOWN hill   And cock need pill üíä to work
right on the dot
Open the fucking market. I need to put a load in FLIR. üöÄ $50
BABA puts at open?
I‚Äôll buy BABA if it gets close to $200
Proof?
Looks like BABA is catching some bids around 230
My bet is a $20.50 open on GME.
Hurry! I haven't ever sent her any bear memes it's gotta mean something!
Just curious, what is your basis for this position?  There are plenty of other stocks with similar gains, are they all musicals chairs?
Yea, I know! Buying ROPE atm
Can anyone make a bull case ? Or explain flatness over months ? Maybe I‚Äôll hold through next ER....
Why are we open on Christmas Eve, its not like im getting anything done today.
Maybe... and probably. But you could say something similar about any time of year.
new strain of covid-19 in florida
i bought shares the calls seemed exp, but i woulda made more on the calls lol
It‚Äôs actually not as bad. Pltr has a legitimate argument as a company. The only reason these morons keep parroting GME is because some guy is telling them this mythical short squeeze will happen. There is 0 value in the underlying stock, it‚Äôs just a technical play that I would guess maybe 1% of the people saying ‚ÄúGME GME GME üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ‚Äù even understand
üê¥BIO $5 June ‚Äò21 calls
I believe the stock will bounce after the weekend after all this noise going into the holiday
Too low pt
Baba is the backbone of Chinese companies finding buyers for their junk...  Hurting baba would just destroy Chinese exports  Hence this is just posturing by the bug people
The bill is omnibus spending bill, not a Covid bill. If even has tax write-offs for corporate lunches that Trump wanted in there. They‚Äôre making excuses and sabotaging the economy to fuck with Dems. That‚Äôs republicans for you. Also $2 billion extra to add to the Space Force lol
*down 70% eod*
Yes lets buy leaps when IV is high as fuck
Don‚Äôt play BABA. You‚Äôre welcome.
that was from fed hiking interest rates
Look at KODK or OSTK.
Thank you for the Made in China gifts
Setting a BABA buy limit at $219.99. Steal at that price.
Now that my calls have expired, yes
BEHOLD - THE DUALITY OF MAN  IN ONE CORNER, WE HAVE THE PEOPLE PANIC SELLING THEIR BABA CALLS  IN THE OTHER CORNER, WE HAVE PEOPLE OPENING NEW BABA POSITIONS  **NEXT WEEK THE SAME PEOPLE BUYING BABA CALLS TODAY WILL BE SELLING THEM TO NEW DIP BUYERS WHEN BABA HITS 200**

How are tech stocks looking? Everything took a massive dump, E.g. Cloudflare in the last 10 minutes of trading. And these stocks are barely up 0.7% pre market. Is it going to be more selling over the weekend?

This BABA situation is not as straightforward.  BABA is not an american company where the courts function properly. IF the communist party has a bone to pick with BABA they WILL get their pound of flesh.  All comes down to behind closed door dick sucking happening right now.  The nightmare scenario will be if Xi does to BABA what putin has done to many Oligarchs he disapproved of in Russia...

It's a bit boring, but it is easy and pretty safe money.  Just seldom get explosive gains.

You should tell these Americans. They're the ones moving the needle.  Blackrock, Bridgewater, Vanguard, Fidelity, Ark, Third Point, Gates Foundation, Appaloosa, Invesco, and T Rowe.
BABA hodlers just had their christmas ruined lmao. even ppl just holding shares feeling a 10% drawdown.

Realistically though, we could see a 21.99 open
I mean I‚Äôm all for tax write offs, that means less taxes. If the government wanted to stimulate they could cancel tax. Stop taking money from A to give it to B.
Once all this settles down, BABA is going to be biggest opportunity!

Lol this is a monopoly investigation not fraud
$baba leaps
Time to sell
BABA is making sure you have something to hang on the christmas tree
DAMN Futures just broke out on volume !
Solid DD, bro.
Well they should actually
Xl just went -7 to +7 loool
Well, ultimately the government has to perform its function as a social safety net. Which means taxes are redistributive in nature. That‚Äôs why they‚Äôre percent driven and progressive. The more you received from society, the more you have, and the more you will give back to keep society running.
You have no self confidence, my big dick comment will get tons of upvotes
I was pretty upset about buying WMT calls right before the opioid rumor lawsuit but now I‚Äôm just thankful I sold my BABA calls for a profit last week. A true Christmas miracle
Shares guy here and I‚Äôm feeling sick to stomach
NGGA please
You probably meant to say ‚Äúexpired worthless‚Äù
Definitely not. Zero appeal there. Why pair up with a shitty auto manufacturer when there are plenty of others that are more tech savvy and ahead of the curve

Holy shit oc.gn had 900million trades yesterday. If it dips below 2 today im loading up

Honestly who is running things at apple? Really? No EV till 2024? Do you have any idea how far ahead Tesla would be by then? Semi, roadster, Y and cypertruck would of flooded the market by then
Volume about to be low as duck today?
Good combo
Every news agency biases their view point and adds flavor to what someone said. Politics and news is toxic.
Imagine not having a position. In GH.IV right now.
Lol to be fair there are good advisors out there.  Several member-only websites employ a team to just dig into companies all day and put out a recommendation only when they find something; quality not quantity
So what see in the mean time is adding more apple products into Ford vehicles. Using Ford factories take some make them ev factories also.

I was up big on that bounce a few weeks ago.. ended up selling when it came down and I was even.. thank god I did. I had 30k in calls.
But men falling ok their own sword  They will cut their exports in half if they hurt alibaba
If you don‚Äôt FOMO üêù, you ain‚Äôt homo
At least
Yeah my personal take is that this is the most likely scenario. MA's just gotta suck some dick and get in line. I think Xi will use this more as a warning to other companies to get in line and know whose the boss.   Nightmare scenario is if Xi does to BABA what Putin has done to oligarchs he didn't like essentially forcing them to give up their businesses
 Melvin capital a bunch of sad cucks

My first time buying 4 hour FDs wish me luck

open a SPY chart we were 368.19 on Dec 4 and barely 2% above or below that this entire month. were 368.11 now. thetagang won.

Alright BABA shareholders - are we selling at open?
Tsa travellers 1m Everyday... nobody cares about corona
Probably not that good of a day to trade lol
Anyone else holding TSLA or QS calls? Gimme your projections for today and next week!
Nonsense.
Congrats theta gang. Not buying anything till last 5 mins of day. Then all in on puts for the rug pull next Monday.
buy the BABA dip, that is all
boys eriously. get in to XL.  1 thing about SPACs is that there is too many. Citron basically did the DD from all the EV SPACs and said XL is a winner. its going to Valhalla.
GME making me nut everyday I love it
Then go to wendys
i laughed, and i cried.
lol where is the guy who bought BABA calls yesterday
PLTR with that 9 am red dildo as is tradition. Next up - anotha one at 9:30.

Slowly? Ur doing it wrong
Goddam qs 1 month chart
I trusted you China! You dishonour my family this Christmas.
Last week I sold me TSLA calls Friday afternoon, at close it jumped like $50. Is that gonna happen again? Should I buy some $690-700 lottos at open?
Imagine thinking a $2t company was limited in what it could do. Please
Smiling and laughing with the Family at christmas while crying deep down about my BABA Position.
Someone on here randomly said they don't fuck with Chinese companies. I wish I could thank him - kept me away from BABA
The government acting as a social safety net is a huge hindrance to the economy, throughout most of our countries history you relied on your family, and community for support in hard times. If you believe society has the obligation to help others, they should do it directly, not by using the government to take other people‚Äôs money to pay for it.
When U/DEEPFUCKINGVALUE is out, everyone should be out.
I reappy dont knlw at this point, I have shares from 280...
I bought one XL 1/15/21 $25c at $7.00. It ain‚Äôt much, but it‚Äôs mine.
Ok good suggestion
Saw this. Of course more vaccines the better but is it going to be too little to late?
Absolutely. Both shares and leap calls are looking really good for CRM.
Sell if you have a ‚Äúfuck China‚Äù mentality which is fair after this fiasco. Hold if you understand that your emotions in the market are temporary.
XL is pumping like a madman on christmas week with no volume. once ppl get back from holiday this is going past 50 easily.
$SBE üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüë®‚ÄçüöÄ

Why didn't I get XL 30c when they were $450
which way will AAPL shoot today. Probably down right?
Next Stop: Moon
Time to short PLTR
well that what i was doing and in 10k loss. stfu
If this doesn't pan out, I feel like there'll be a lot of people calling for his blood over a pump-and-dump.
What‚Äôs the merger they are working on?
The PR team sucks and theres no big firm giving it a price target. Itll trade flat until that happens
Yes everybody please do!!
Sold tsla last week to buy baba calls.  I'm sorry Papa Elon. I'll never bet against you and America again.
Yes read their latest earnings statement - right direction financially as well as operationally which will support / increase their bottom line. Although they‚Äôre well poised to execute their financial improvement initiatives (favorable working capital, removing redundancies in store, SG&amp;A, etc) the question still remains how successful they‚Äôll be in their transition into e-commerce vs giants such as steam and not to mention potential competitors coming into the market (far stretch but perhaps Amazon or other international players)
Set a limit buy at $20 until cancelled and just wait for it to trigger... Probably won't ever happen, but if something goes horribly wrong at PLTR, you'll be able to find out quickly.
With such little volume today, this sub could actually control the market   I‚Äôm guessing GME and PLTR
It would become the best vaccine out there if true.
palantir fuck meeeeee
Thats what im saying. Got it at 10.50, may hold post merger for that dividend and go full boomer
I got 6 x 29$ weeklys for .04 a contract. YOLO

Is that a real flavor?! Thought limoncello was the bottom of the barrel
My "please fly again" message must have not gotten through
Only 3.5 hours of trading. I feel cheated.
If you're gonna burn money, do it with $HYLN calls
The very first time I read the phrase "sTonKs onLy Go uP" I though the top was surely in.   If I had just believed it and bought leap calls on almost anything, I'd be a very rich man.   At least from then until now, the stonks did indeed only go up.
Google helps a lot.  They lay out the bill and it‚Äôs spending.  PPP, extra unemployment, State aid, farmers, and wierd pork spending shit.  Yeah some of that shit is wasteful, but consider the alternative of not passing it.
He's made her plenty of money over the S&amp;P. I just find it funny every time I get the email. Today it was MGNI.

If GME hits 23 in the first hour of trading it will save christmas
It‚Äôs funny
lol y‚Äôall know what happens, market opens and every ticker goes red just like usual
Baba 190 eod
Fk u
üôèüöÄ
Dear SPY,   if you could hit 370 again today I would make good money. If you would hit 369, I would make a little money. If you would stay above 368 I wouldn't lose too much money.   If you go below that, I'm going to be very disappointed and personally offended.
today‚Äôs a good day to take profit on shorter exp calls and buy shares and leaps for next quarter
Nobody tell him
The issue is that this will be dead money for who knows how long? Could be a year before this rebounds
Yep, no one is buying this dip...
Imagine options on options... fd on fd
Cohen
what should i swing today
Because it‚Äôs dying and easy to manipulate
Nobody ever lost money by securing gains
BABA continuing its run down as it kills itself. Thinking now would be a great entry point to get in on this ride back up.
I‚Äôm going to average down lol
They are. Expect them in Q1 2021 tho, not now
If TSLA shoots up it will be a Festivus miracle.
XL was promoted by Shitron... can anyone explain why people are shilling it?
i said that last time BABA crashed about a month ago, and look where i'm at now. You'd think i'd learn a lesson, but that wouldn't be retarded. instead, think i'm gonna have to yolo a few more contracts at a discount. BUY THE DIP
Stonks close at 1 pm today
I‚Äôm at 265 avg, the issue is it could be a year before this revounds
$30 and I‚Äôll chug Leroy‚Äôs Coconuts
Calls on your number of chromosomes.
Green Morning Everyday.
This green pm gonna give me blue balls...
is your pp smol? or is it XL
Real party is three kings day. Everyone walk in the ocean backwards and naked. Let‚Äôs just say shit gets weird.
[removed]
I don‚Äôt think it reaches $20 but a retest of $25 would be nice before breaking convincingly over $30+
Weren‚Äôt they previously PIC?
Should I sell my BABA 300c 3/21 today??
FCEL 200 Shares @ $12.00
Imagine selling today
Im thinking BABA after this huge drop
Thanks random WSB guy, it‚Äôs not like there are a hundred tickers getting spammed everyday.
And Hanukkah üïé
Exactly. The hard part is what to think about the GA runoff senate elections. If dems win it will probably jump to 50 lol
Stimulus talks going well...
Cathie wood loves it
watch me turn this half day into a no day while staring at candles all morning
This place is great
that 695 last week was a preview
should i wait for a dip to buy XL or is that boy mooning
Baba money gonna rotate into OZON and JMIA
STIC is way too high to buy, the damn merger isn‚Äôt even until q2
the flattest pre market i have ever seen in my life, what the hell?
MGNI and DFS will either get me a lambo for Xmas or ramen.
Lol
Just buy it for tendies
Imagine selling at Christmas, fucking unpatriotic pussies
BABA$ HAS BEEN #EXCOMMNICADO
Ah ok thank you üëçüèª
bought baba calls yesterday  merry christmas
Sold my shares last night, but leaps are dead
Fuck all of you
Papa Elon please let my TSLA 655 12/24 FD‚Äôs print... üôèüôèüôèüôèü•∫ü•∫ü•∫
PLZ SPY 370
Michael Burry said so
not moonin üò≠
Exactly this. I‚Äôve been saying this but people who believe these ‚Äúprobes‚Äù are similar to the US and are non-material are fucking delusional.
The only reasonable explanation
Okay TMO please don‚Äôt immediately give up gains at open thank you.
It‚Äôs not gay if Elon does it to you
Is BTWN still a 50/50 on landing Tokopedia?
Congress adjourned. Neither party got unanimous consent for their agendas. Next session on Monday 2pm lol
Someone give me a good call to spend $100 on pls
Haven't heard that in 12 seconds
Is PLTR really staying below 29 until next year?
they make an electric/hybrid power sources basically. you can just integrate it into established production lines. rather than produce whole vehicles themselves. makes alot of sense seeing as even TSLA has trouble meeting production quotas even thugh they have plenty of money and facilities.
Amen
Now Nio dying because baba fuck China
Averaging down personally
Fuck PLTR, I had to say it
Y
No shit.
4/16 $19 VALE call
This. Plus I get a ton of head. Idk if it‚Äôs the culture or what, but I get head almost every morning.
no, it's 3 days old.
i sold some at 1.60
Buying options on riot or mt is like buying options on options if you think about it.
700 eod
What you get?
GME shares right now
650 here. 10 of them
Basically, they have a hybrid solution already in place and on the road. Lots of customers. Growth potential in a few years is solid.   Not sure if $35 solid, but there's definitely nothing wrong with it, especially with the current EV madness.
Prob
BABA$    #FATALITY üî•üî•üî•üî•ü©∏ü©∏ü©∏ü©∏
What will the bug men do?  Break Ali baba up?
Bears in shambles
GME TO 10
My stocks always fucking moon right before open. I hate this shit.
If you don‚Äôt have already have a plan, then yeah sell while you‚Äôre ahead
God the people talking about BABA in here are so fucking retarded. Do you really think our trading day is going to do anything different then HKs, where the fucking company is located? The day is already mapped out, go look at baba.HK, add $5-7, that‚Äôs where we close.
Baba leap
A collect call to both your dads
Look at chewy son. It‚Äôs early
With BABA getting hit with monopoly anti-trust, those damn Chinese commies really will not let us profit seeking capitalists gain too much control.  Long JD.
That‚Äôs because it‚Äôs ‚Äúpleas‚Äù
XL is anything but flat.
Wait for the drop of the first 30 minutes and buy 0 date calls
Myself?!üòÇüòÇüòÖüòÇ
Half day... most institutional traders are off today... going to be very low volume... let‚Äôs squeeze the crap outta GME and show analysts the true power of WSB. Shares not calls!
Do i sell my baba Jan 2022s ?
Btfd
I‚Äôm not sure you quite understand what it is you‚Äôre saying.  Even if they ‚Äúopened up‚Äù everything, which for the most part already are save a couple states, unemployment is high right now and some of those jobs just aren‚Äôt there anymore.  Congress dragged their feet too long and the effects of it are not proportionate.    So if you think it‚Äôs wasteful, when you get your $600 you should probably send yours back.
it dipped this morning but it got gobbled up.
OK Greatest Generation
seems that a lot of people are betting it's a done deal
Baba$. Oh boy all the margin calls and stop losses we about to see
they always pop when a merger is announced and then drop down, just wait a few weeks.
I'm loaded to the tits with February calls
yikes
Yeah but it's up 17% premarket
9:30 dump into 10:30, trade flat all day, EOD dump at 12:50
Watt 05-21 $4c
What do you think about buying $BABA dip at open?
Oh it‚Äôs mooning. It‚Äôs hitting 60
It's going to baidu
ITS GONNA BE THE SUMMER OF GMEORGE
DONT SELL YOU PUSSIES
ü§£
XL Calls?
hoping for more from FEYE today :pray:
Yeah... Could use that money elsewhere for sure. Just hate selling this at a loss
Not for sq$ it‚Äôs gonna sky rocket bruh
literally woke up and bought the XL dip. merry xmas to me.
tell me more about this FLIR you speak of
u sir are a raging psychopath
Baba gonna rape me in 15 minutes. Anyone think market is overreacting? Should I average down at open?
Looks like this fucking retard u/Durado made another account
All I know is that it's 100% tendies.
i believe it may hit 42-44 today, just don‚Äôt know if i should expect a dip for short sellers
Ford started making cars 100+ years before Tesla. guess that headstart didn't matter much.
So no 2k ?
Baba calls at open for a quick in and out
Imagine how scared those ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù shorters must be right now.
Doesn‚Äôt seem like it‚Äôs going to happen but it‚Äôs a great management so next target might be even better
Real shit is there gonna be a GME dip I can wait for or do I need to get in ASAP
Everyone's got fomo, if you're lucky, there might be a dip, btfd
Darn shimmy till Monday
Pltr gonna get manipulated as fuk today.
What üêù gonna do
Thankfully, a lot of people here were saying that- it helped reinforce that point. As great a company is Baba, they can‚Äôt beat the govt
[removed]
Yeah for sure. Maybe even a few months. There‚Äôs bound to be some deep lows imo
All I see is more stimi news pumping next week lmao ü§°ü§° market only goes up
My entire watchlist is green...except for GOEV.  üò∂
Shares? Sure  Options? Whats the expiration
[removed]
A male escort with a fat bulge   Enjoy your Christmas my friend
One the warrants get called then the gap shrinks to $11.50 or thereabouts
vote on monday now
Whole watchlist is green as fuck. I have a bad feeling this shit is about to dump
BABA ah ah ah  BABA Ooh la la
Do you really want to bet against xi jinping
There's a weird 28.8 resistance on PLTR that's so freaking horizontally straight.
**I BETTER SEE BABA LOSS PORN TODAY**
Apparently the house vote just failed. Market unmoved. Holy shit.
no, u buy more
the fact it jumped after a post from a respectable WSB member is so absurd for me to think about lmao, we are the market movers now
More stimi talks again
I'm in the same boat... Rip us
No, retard.
Any call recommendations to buy at market open for this week ?
Wait for a dip, if there is one today
when will i learn that premarket means NOTHING
She's cute I hope she replaces Becky. Im too hungover for that crow so it was a pleasant surprise to see the new Burnette
I‚Äôm so fucked
My Amzn put credit spread shows a larger loss than my collateral on Robinhood. Is there some possibility that my max losses could exceed my collateral? I thought losses were capped at the difference in strike minus the credit received.
Do you like losing money?
Baba gonna need the resurrecting stone. Jack ma stand by
Gme
Who knows?
For me game console cycle and Ryan Cohen
üëÄG anyone?

i'm worrying about the same thing
I hate pltr
STIC on a moon mission with volume lol
I'm serious I need a win what yall got. 45 dte plz
GUH
Hold NIO or fomo into XL?
Should I wait for a dip to buy the McRib or should I go all in when McDonalds open?
I don‚Äôt expect it to go below $19
We‚Äôre full up here  üá®üá¶
i have an AAPL 1/8 132c and i‚Äôm ready to start crying
buy the dip fellas
Buy 10 GME shares if you read this
That is the way. The american way
And now they will be free to fall out of relevance without the EU.
Exp August 21
Only baba if u in that u were already a traitor
Fellow retards, what do we think of Social Capital?
Macy‚Äôs stock
Everything I own is fuk today
See what happens first , I bet people will sell the stock because of the FUD for the first 5 mins and you can buy it at the bottom unless it's not the bottom and it will go down more next week. Then you should wait and after new years.
No stimulus was priced in
What are we predicting GME to hit?
Gonna rip at open I can feel it. They‚Äôre gonna try to shake us out in the first 10 minutes
Hoping for a nice little CRM gain today
Also CRWD is poised to explode
Cathie buy GME when
This is why Elon is smart by ass kiss China every time
Palantir ‚Äì "I love it when you talk dirty to me."
Yes, but you're here, right? I'd say wait for a dip if you're gonna hold long term. But there will probably be a rush to buy this morning (I assume you also saw the SIR_JACK_A_LOT DD).
Unemployment is high because of government restrictions preventing people from working, shopping, etc. The government needs to spend less, not more.
DON'T FOMO INTO XL BUY NGA
Stimulus talks going well
Since Congress is adjourned until Monday, what would get us to 370? Brexit deal?
all in.    Put's on your colon btw
if they made a flavor called Bottom of the Barrel, I bet hipsters would rave about it

You dropped these 00
guys youre still early to XL. remember most traders and big money took the entire week off.
Bleh, I am still drunk from last night.
average down
Imagine when Apple first launched, and went up 18% so someone said fuck it.
I also need to know the answer to this.
With this volume, its shooting sideways again
It's not really hard. You find the right SPACs and you go all in on calls if possible. Easiest money I've ever made.
Hold or sell SQ calls at open (235c 12/31)
Yup
24
It‚Äôs Christmas Eve how do bears even have the audacity to speak.
No stimulus talks until 28th December. ü§°ü§°ü§°
There will be many different numbers.

Was there any prior indication XL was going to moon like this?
Almost like someone‚Äôs selling
Jumped in XL yesterday at 25. Got stopped out at 24. An hour later the Citron tweet oof

Dude, we're going green. I'm just trying to work out if I sell as soon as I see green. I'm never doing this with weeklies again
Fuck I guess I should as well. Own some in an IRA.
I think by the time we see a dip it‚Äôll hit 38-40
BTWN up 17% premarket
Imagine if nio went down too. Need me some popcorn
XL is making me rich but I might roll some into Pershing in case there‚Äôs a Christmas miracle?
Who was the original vale dd guy. Thank you sir
XL? Omg these Blank check companies need to fucking stop already.
The day I get aggressive on my covered calls and sell a $30 weekly is the day it will take off.

Do I sell my april 2021 300c ?
It‚Äôs only up 134% this week.
great GME dd this morning from a guy who noticed that BABA is the 2nd largest long holding of Melvin Capital, the single biggest GME short.  BABA tanking could put a lot of margin pressure on them, depending on their financing setup.  Thought this was a pretty interesting/compelling point.
F to my baba call holders

Totally. People should invest in good old fashioned American companies that horde all of their money and resources in Ireland and other tax havens üá∫üá∏
Same douche that dumped LMND this morning dumped RKT. Fuk that üåà fuk
üèíüê∂ Gang how we feeling? PM looks good to me, though wondering why Sir Jack's post got removed
I find it very frustrating when someone puts a ten bagger in here and I look up the symbol and uhhhh I can't even trade options on it??? Are we gambling or not whats going on here
Wow my account is about to blow up today on PLTR calls unless there is a miracle
Please go uppies SPY, I need to get out of my FDs for not 80% loss :'(
Trump completely fucked it over.  The spending bill + stimulus bill was passed by both Houses.
Bought at open, prolly fucked myself
Not ICLN
Its up premarket tho, you got puts?
All in BABA
I‚Äôm fucking excited for it to drop tn
PLUG price action going haywire
use margin to go all in on GOEV. you will get it before end of month
we might get somewhere!
Let‚Äôs go VALE huge new contract
Look, BABA is chasing Xmas card money, cute....
You forget the market makes no sense my friend. Just watch it dump
It was always going to happen, seriously you thought it had a shot? Lol
BABA$ investors   ‚Äú you got to know when to hold em , know when to fold em ‚Äú   ‚ÄúKnow when to suck cock and learn how to cry ‚Äú
Well the call it now $10, so it didn‚Äôt seem like I burned money.
I mean it‚Äôs going to be .01 so you might as hold
Twitter is balls deep in it. There are calendars with what phase each one is in and when the merger vote is.
PLTR and a morning dump name a better duo
I was promised a short squeeze today
They know you were going to YOLO and lose it anyway so they just skipped a step for you
Baba puts at open orrrr????
Congress should give a specific stimulus to us BABA share holders
If you do spreads, you need margin.
Amen
Missed out huh?
This is possibly a dumb question, but how the fuck do y‚Äôall know what companies these blank check spacs are trying to merge with? Like XL was previously PIC, did y‚Äôall know PIC was turning into XL beforehand?
Think it still has legs?
Hahahahahah
Hope y'all get in on PRCH stock early. First day of new ticker symbol, similar company to LMND. Shit is gonna take off
Yeah seriously fuck that guy
I just downloaded the Webull desktop app for the first time last night, this shit is bitchin
Jeez baba still drilling f u China
Nancy and ü•≠ teaming up to provide tendies
Hows PLTR doing?  üöÄ?
\- 2k check amendment to covid relief package has already failed today.   \- on Monday, democrats will introduce standalone bill for 2k checks.
I‚Äôm getting in XL on open?
no fucking clue feels overbought
Told y‚Äôall about $stic yesterday   If it trades anywhere near $chwy eval my god were mooning
Ready your bussies. GME is going to dump hard at open. Like yesterday, it will fly once again.
Can't stop WON'T STOP! Why would you want them to, just buybuybuy and STACK TENDIES BB.
ByeByeBaba
All aboard the STIC rocket ship üí∞üöÄ
Calls but they for 3200, think theta is guna hurt
MGNI gang  How long are you holding?
Accurate
I took out VIX calls expecting this block but I wonder if the market priced it in
ETSY üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ
Support is at 215 200 and then march.
Wow AMD a week in the red already; did Su Bae get caught in Jack Ma‚Äôs bed?
Was thinking the same thing
TSLA 700c
i said i would buy baba near 200 at 5am today and people laughed at me. it might actually hit today.
Why stop there when you can be a multi-trillionaire?
Fastly
Rip
They also require margin for naked
Buying more Gme.
F
Haha. .01 for Jan 2022 calls? Dear God let‚Äôs hope not.
CLDR calls
Lol
That‚Äôs it NIO üíÉüèª
1. Anyone who actually thought 2k would be approved is a fucking tard and clueless about the legislative process  2. Baba is being investigated by the CCP not the SEC. get your head out of your ass and realize this is only the beginning
government shutdown. SPY 320 here we come!
XL sell off at open
I assume none. Because doing anything more than basic buying options has the risk of losing more money than you have
Genuinely curious about this too.
I was so close to going big on BABA leaps about a month ago. So glad I can lose that money in an otherwise heartbreaking fashion.
by the time it's done drilling...it'll be in the courthouse
IMAGINE INVESTING IN GYNA BABA$  WHEN THE USA HAS GOOD CORRUPT COMPANIES THAT U KNOW JPOW WONT LET FALL   üòÇüòÇü§£ü§£ü§£üòÇüòÇ  Keep the money in the USA   USA NUMBA WHAN #1
Pleas fly again
POS is definitely going to the next support lvl...
How low can NKLA go
I truly think they should make a movie about GME and the short squeeze. I think it would be fascinating. They could call it the Big Long ^green dildo
If American Airlines doesn‚Äôt fall today I‚Äôm shutting myself it was up 1% premarket on some fucking garbage news.   Heavily in debt at beginning of 2020 and completely burning through cash the rest of it
I‚Äôm in
It moved the stock, materially  Could be considered manipulation
Swear to me
Someone tell me my XPEV 4/21 50c will be okay?
Nope
That's it? Damn I thought there was some actual movement.
at 230, seems like a good price for you to double down!
CNBC.  Turn off the cartoons.
Vito Corleone
I‚Äôm in
so it's not good...
Its being bought up in premarket so far but 675 doesn‚Äôt seem realistic for today
How? That bill is still sitting at his desk, he didn‚Äôt veto it
DD
Calm down $BABA holders, now not the time for fear   That comes later
680 here
PLTR fade at open is as predictable as my wife cooking a shitty dinner
Good  They shouldn‚Äôt have turned this into the mega spending spree BS in the first place  Send the checks  They can do their pork bs for Israel in another bill
Link? I don't see that anywhere yet?
Right we‚Äôre it ended yesterday so prepare for the epic sell off
OPEN THE MARKET LET ME AT EM LET ME AT EM!
why do i always believe these posts for a second even though i know they‚Äôre based on nothing
Read the company news
Chicoms cannot be fucked with, rip BABA
The focus of the BABA investigation is actual monopolistic behavior (requiring merchants not to seek through other platforms). If China just imposes a measured punishment of a large fine, like the West would impose, I think this would recover pretty quickly and signals that capital investment is safe in China.
Shitron put a PT of $60 on XL, thoughts?
What kind of company are they?
You comparing share price?
They never email me back anyways
I win if you win, brother
How can I reduce the loss of my shitty baba calls? Is there any possibility? (I am extremely retarted pls be sorry)
Yes.  SPACs sign a nonbinding LOI, then a confirmed DA.
I‚Äôll buy it. We can meet at police station at noon. I have cash.
Thank you for your service
Anyone see the wmt owners and directors dumped a fuck ton of there shares? Or is that too much dd for this sub? Puts?
üò≠ü•≤
No, but will certainly keep climbing
So I should put an order in for 205?
So what? Business can be hard, sometimes hurricanes happen, earthquakes, etc. The government getting involved doesn‚Äôt help it hurts, they print money, it causes inflation on assets, which pushes poor people further away from things like home ownership in the future. The government doesn‚Äôt need to step in and rescue anyone, especially not a business. I run a business, if for some reason what I did stopped being profitable, I would do something else, almost immediately. People are supposed to adapt, not wait for the big government to come fix their problems.
I love getting together with all my bros and getting a massage train going. I love my homies.

To the 0.3 people in this subreddit smart enough to understand this, here's my outlook 5 minutes before the market opens for today:  The heat map of the global power struggle between authoritarians and libertarians is acting a lot like the heat map of climatic temperature offsets. Hot and cool zones moving around the earth sporadically and unpredictably. Right now the west is relatively cool but the east is fluctuating wildly around varying but all above-normal levels of heat like it has been for over a year now and a lot of things that have been bending the whole time are at their breaking point. Since they're on the faux-communism control scheme in most of that hemisphere, the power struggle being in a heat wave in that hemisphere overall means faux-communism is lashing out at capitalism globally right now while the faux-capitalists in the west can afford to take the hit without too much liberty bubbling up in their spheres. Putin will continue ordering Xi to attack capitalists and consolidate the CCCP's power as long as he's dealing with Navalny, and as long as the US is paralyzed by this game of chicken we keep playing with our impending civil war, he doesn't really need to give our injuries much focus. The UK with their border/supply chain crisis is honestly worth more of Putin's attention than the US right now. So the USD is going to keep sliding to make the market look good relative to it, our market will basically keep looking like a circus with random shit happening and news going haywire all the time to keep the cycle of chaos in a stable balanced back-and-forth loop between the bulls and the bears, and most of the interesting action where real shit is happening based on real factors is going to be from the east. So if you like doing actual analysis-based trading for big gains and you're not just here for the casino of gambling on random ups and downs of the circus, pay attention to what's happening with BABA and try playing your money in a country with anything going on other than America's chaos-on-autopilot situation. Trust me, there are enough foreign companies on Robinhood these days, you don't have to sled downhill with USD all winter or hope to get lucky with something like GME by pure random chance.  *In the meeting of mined; down in the streets of shame; in the betting of Names on gold to rust; in the land of the blind, be King*
Your XPEV 4/21 50c will be ok
Why Jan?
Stop asking if Baba call or puts you retards, it's a power struggle and Ma pissed off the current emperor of China. This won't be ending any time soon until China gains full control of BAT.
F for the BABA bois
Stimmy got blocked. Blood red day
Alright scrappy doo
Google is hard?
ze-r0
Too late to get into STIC?
No 2000$ checks got vetoed
The mind is too strong the name may be agreed with but the conditions are still there  With that being said.... yes I know I don‚Äôt have ADHD I just tune out the BS too muchb
XL price target is $60, we're at $35 pre-market. This is gonna be a big fomo pump today prob
BABA is a fucking steal. I‚Äôll buy 10x Made in China stonks please.
ARKG
You‚Äôre fine dude
Down at open, slow climb through the day, drop 10 minutes before close... as tradition dictates.
I‚Äôm not gunna tell you to go long on Ark, just put them on your watch list. They‚Äôll do the rest of the talking from there.
Who else buying STIC? At open lol
I thought it was 255 so I bought a ton yesterday. Hasn‚Äôt closed below 255 since July. Then this shit happens. What can I say I‚Äôm retarded
Feeling good. Bought 100 shares yesterday at 3pm, after reading that post. If PM holds up then I'm up 20%+ since then.
When people say baba leaps they mean off a tall building right?
I have been watching Big Mouth on Netflix. Maury fucking kills me. "So uh, what are we talkin' about, tits?" "My proctologist won't believe I didn't do this to myself."
Wait for XL dip
So buy calls?
thank u sir
BABA traded at a low of $226 in Hong Kong
Idk what to do

GOODBYE STIMULUS CHECK
thats called a pocket veto. delays the process for 2 weeks
Pretty heavy coverage now though:  https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/24/house-votes-on-2000-stimulus-checks-after-trump-supports-them.html
Definitely a dumb question.
Good day for icln 2022 leaps? Cannot see clean energy slowing any time soon, especially with creepy joe around the corner.
Stimulus talks continue Monday, Market continues as optimism continues
Yeah :(
"Oh great its that chicken pasta dish again? Sweet" I'm in the same boat
Just put $6K into Microstrategy in the Roth so that I‚Äôll have something if there‚Äôs a rug pull.
Get a different wife
Too late to get in gme...?
u/GatorMD12 check your chats
Nga will run up aswell and you can make the same gains with less risk
Not sure. It's a falling knife but that could go both ways in uncertainty. All most people know is there is an investigation. Whether or not it has teeth will show what happens. If it's a breakup then it's an elevator down to hell but just them showboating their power and a rebound
Baba at June levels....yikes
Got blocked you mean
So who is dumping their BABA calls right at the bottom? I‚Äôm going to hold üò§üò§üò§üò§
GOP blocked house dems in passing $2000 stimmy.  GME 30 01/15
why did i not follow the stock market when i was 18. as a 23 year old i feel as if ive missed out on so much (which I have). i could have finessed so much money from my parents and just bought stocks during college fuck
didnt get vetoed.  house is drafting a new bill that will include the $2k checks, and it will die in the senate.
Wow holy fuck RIP BABA  This time it's really fucking dead
yes
5 minutes to Valhalla retards!
Lol u/sir_jack_alot only picks winners
Gonna need a tldr on this one
With BABA tanking, what comparable company should moon?
Highkey needed this stimulus check so that‚Äôs really great they teased us for 9 months :/
Why are they so mad at alien head all of the sudden
Gereat buying op
MARA,RIOT AND EBON üöÄ
I will not buy at open.  I will not buy at open.  I will not buy at open.
How is aapl looking today?
They have been for years.  People blowing their accounts up trying to short it since the beginning.
They're called "insurance tech" companies. Basically make homebuying and everything involved with it way easier. Check out their website Porch.com
Nah. It‚Äôs based on MSFT news about how, they too (like Apple), will design their own chips rather than using Intel or AMD‚Äôs
Sssssh Everyone Clam up.
Bulls will be getting a big red dildo as a Christmas present today
The big squeeze that sqouze
A limit down day on Christmas would be a fitting end to this fucking wild-ass year...
Over shorted, beginning of new console cycle, low debt, hostile takeover, E-commerce growth, and share value +375% across the last three months.
Too late indeed

buy and hold for some quick change. You won't regret it.
Everything will selloff once it becomes certain our do-nothing gov't shuts down with no stimulus in sight and the whole package goes back to the drawing board. IWM 1/15 162p for premium flip. Bought a bunch yesterday for 30c.
Huge buy order on NIO.  40,000 shares
Yeah I don't care if they do, just want my $

Btw it's unanimous consent that failed iirc. Thats to be expected because R will want a floor vote
Sitting on the sidelines today. Should be entertaining

&gt;ETSY  id like to get out before the dip then buy back
There is not going to be any 2k stimmy. It was a stunt.
Butt wipes have been sold out on amazon for ages now  Puts on my dirty butt crack
can we get other stocks too at june levels..would love to load up again lol
It's a really weak stimulus. $600 and $300/week UI is too little, too late. He has leverage now to force McConnell to pass a bill with bigger direct payments, and I agree with him for once.
OPEN THE GATES!
https://twitter.com/RocketManGuyMan/status/1340741894184161280?s=09
$600 $1200 $2000 Idfc  At this point just pass something and let‚Äôs move on
you crazy if you sell NIO now. Major catalysts upcoming.
Very exciting times
Baba calls anyone?
Thanks retard
Bears in shambOs  Bulls picking out lambOs
If you‚Äôre not buying NIO and Xpeng you honestly don‚Äôt love free money
Yes I picked up 20k worth at 143.70  Give it a month to near earnings it will rocket
Pleas drive again NIO
Least it‚Äôll be more than a weeks worth of groceries beer and weed
tHiS iS oNlY tHe BeGiNnInG
Name a stock you would have missed out on without wsb
I am thinking it will fall little more from here before the end of the year. But it will roar back by early Feb when earnings are due.  Also, China isn‚Äôt gonna tank one of their biggest and best companies. It will be a slap on the wrist like the Luckin Coffee fine
nope
GME eod predictions?
Can you guys stop pumping STIC for a minute so I can buy in, thanks
FIST ON CHEST, NO FEAR!   Also, Merry Christmas you filthy animals.
Hold or sell SQ calls at open (235c 12/31)? Looks like its about to drop quick
Funny that the year ends how it began
$2k stimmy failed, shit is going to drill.
can someone explain this GME obsession to me, a dumbass
Tl;dr - nothing to see here.
I TAKE BACKWHATI. SAID NIO IM YOUR BIGGEST FAN ILL FOLLOW YOU UNTIL YOU SHORT SQUEEZE
I took profit for thicc B at 18 cos I predicted a dump after that mad rally due to the lack of a DA catalyst, but it's still going up lmao wth
I know. Gives me false hope as my FD‚Äôs drop to zero.
Shit looks like the next XL
What
SSPK because weedmaps

BABA just filling the gap on the daily chart from late June guys. Nothing wrong going on here. Just normal price action. XD
Wow I didn't realize NKLA was already in the 15s, lower than GME lol.
All of them?
Just get a tushy. They are a dream.
Don‚Äôt think anyone expected it to pass tho
GME king swapped to STIC yesterday. Don't miss it.
üëçüèºüòò

Trading Places told me this would be a green day
PEOPLE WHO BUY GME CALLS NOW ARE LITERALLY BUYING THE TOP  IF YOU ARE ALREADY IN, GG NICE JOB  IF YOU AREN‚ÄôT, STAY AWAY LOL
So we‚Äôre not getting that $600 check next week huh
Lobbyists
üçÜüçª
Buy pltr
Any dip buys except baba ? I think Baba has to go below 200 to be a a good buy
Why
BABA ü§§üëÖüåàüêª
It takes like a week to show up on RH, even it shows like it shows up as complete on your banks end; bank transfers are just slow
GME TO A VERY LOW NUMBER :)
ü•≠ is going to absolutely destroy the GOP now. Probably priced in though.
Follor r/SPAC, theres a lot of good discussion there
üò¢
Any 5x today? Any trade ideas
Are you surprised?
Seriously, dont
TLDR - Putin has America running on autopilot right now so nothing but random market swings will happen here just to fuck over traders. Play foreign shit for a little while unless you just love gambling in a gay market
[removed]
I'm in on GME but all the bullshit you assholes are spewing has me worried.  Its starting to sound like PLTR.
Selling BABA right now would be stupidity call holders. You would be selling right at the bottom. üòíüòíüòí
thicc b or GOEV? or too late on both?
2 minutes to find out how stupid am I really
CNRG better
about to take off in a few minutes, should I sell my calls at open? going to be in the air for about an hour
Mane shares, but those 50c expiring today not looking so hot

I agree but like no need to rub salt in the wounds of so many fellow autists
Baba drama going to drill us today
shop
AAPL,PLTR,NET,ATVI,SRNE
Hydrogen is gonna be pushed since its a green energy. I like FCEL better than plug because they do big generators.   Pfizers main campus uses a FCEL fuel cell to power it, not the grid. More things will move this way.
Damn!

This dudes truly are the grinch
SPY moon or tank today? Someone give me a play for today for SPY
Yes
I think it's pretty noteworthy. I've been to my local mall many times and never saw any CNBC employees there in or out of a reporter's capacity
So many BABA autists don‚Äôt even realize Jack MA abandoned ship.   Papa MA will not save you.
FEYE what the shit

Okay having thought about this BABA situation a bit more here is where I‚Äôve landed:  I think it‚Äôs gonna be a slap on the wrist.  BABA is such a poster child for Chinese tech.   The reason I don‚Äôt think they will fuck over BABA  too badly is that it‚Äôs going to have very negative consequences for other chineese companies to be able to raise funding from abroad.  If investors are going to always be worried that the Chineese government can fuck over a tech company they are going to be much less willing to buy shares in chineese companies. It will negatively impact valuations.   So think XI will use this more as a warning shot and not full on fuck them over.  However there is still a small chance obviously that Xi doesn‚Äôt care about any of that and he just has a personal vendetta.  I‚Äôm gonna buy some shares at open and then monitor next few weeks and see which way this is going then buy more if looking like a slap on wrist.   I think there‚Äôs a 30-40 percent upside here if it‚Äôs just a slap on the wrist and I‚Äôm not investing any money I can‚Äôt afford to lose.   I definitely would not YOLO and go all in!
Here we go!!
Why?
same lol
retards... I sold some of my shit and got around $2,000. Gimme a SPAC to throw into.
BABA to $0
For real. And they sell the shittiest shit ever you have to wait three months to get. Knock offs and lies. Would never invest in that garbage.
No clue why.  That‚Äôs some gay ass shit.. mods!

Hi dumbass, I'm retarded. Huge short interest that has to cover, so the price will rise and eventually everyone in this sub with diamond hands will hold the bag.   If you get out early you have fomo. If you get out on time you're rich. If you get out late your calls expire worthless and your shares can be turned in like a used xbox game for 1/20th of their actual value.

VIX is a ETF dedicated to market volatility, when it goes up, generally means theres a lot going on with the market, generally sell offs. SPXS is where bears go to buy calls if overall amount of puts are on the rise. If there is a sell off, generally VIX should go up. SPXS is generally a good indicator for bulls to watch if the market is about to fall on its face. Keep these two plus spy on a watch list and it can be a early indicator if shit is going to hit the fan. Dont know what to make of it with alot of sell off buy these 2 being down
Picked up some baba leaps on the downlow ü§í
PLTR doing the thing again
Fuck you, I‚Äôm buying more CRSR. Shit is gonna be wild in a year

Oh GME? Are you ab to do something?
Back from yesterday with black eyes ready for round two. Let‚Äôs goooo
They also own GME and BB...
If it happens it won't be until a few hours before close. On a normal day that would be maybe 1 or 2pm, today it could be 10 or 11am.
Bullish.
Go AMD you can do this!
AMD let‚Äôs fucking go!!! Su bae
BABA only made my portfolio -15%. I'm still alive. Bought a BABA leap and a Jun cause what else can I do
Come on apple I gotta buy some groceries today.
You'll be fine
Invested in BABA when the first IPO back in 2016. It's an awesome company, but it's tough to invest in companies that are run by a communist government. Sure you have the assurance of the Chinese government in some cases, but that's also the thing that makes investing in these companies scary at times. Luckin Coffee is a very recent example, and now Baba. This is a ploy by Xi to get even with Jack Ma for him trying to have ANT go public without his Ma's consent.
This
While we all want Pltr to take the fuck off already. People in here crying bc it has traded sideways is just dumb. We all knew it was a long play. We got a gift when it went from 15-30 in a week. This support is actually bullish af just chill, it will happen.
Volume is abysmally low. Pretty obvious that it's being pushed down by bigger players

FUBO CRASH AND BURN
Boung is exploding in a few day

Went balls deep in STIC yesterday and I think I sold the top for the first time in my life.  That‚Äôs a wrap for this week boys. Happy holiday!!
The ark hype got me but I‚Äôm out now, everything in those etfs are at crazy all time highs, I was too late and missed the boat, if it has a dip eventually I may get back in.
They have the cheapest price per month in regards to a full sports package versus the competition.
Canoo dipped why though?
This market is going to tank in January. Market is already flat the last 20 days.
i don‚Äôt think ittl go past 132.50 although i hope i‚Äôm wrong

Intentional or not his post legit turned into a pump n dump lol
\+2% -&gt; -4% my paperhands are shaking!
Hope you bought the XL dip

Same tree. Different branch.
Hey VALE, would it help if I got out and pushed???
Probably but I think it's the $65 as a whole that could be concerning. For example alot of people have cut pay tv out and stream sports through other platforms- legal or illegal. I think part of the concern could be that a consumer recession continuing forces people to cancel. Of course this is my guess as to why the PT is at $8
Idk why IPOF is moving but I bought 55 shares yesterday so this works out lol
Ill be bagholding this STIC for a while
Got out of my 50 369 SPY calls for 600$ loss. Lesson learned. Always check the time when you buy for a scalp. (Bought right when market closed) and didn't want to ride them out so I sold at open.
What does that mean?
See ya next week
That was a gift for everyone that missed the last few days. Hope everyone got in.
Aapl getting me my Christmas gift money back. God bless America.
C'mon LAZR you were doing so well
Yea I have no chill and shitty Vanguard filled for 19/share. I will probably dump another spac or CRSR for a loss to average down if I have to
Fuck you BABA fuck you PLTR fuck you TSLA. Fuck you Jack Ma and Xi Dada too. Merry christmas everybody.

Baba dead dead
The board at my hedgefund are all boomers   The 'Three Day Rule' tells investors and stock traders to wait a full three days before buying a stock that has been slammed due to negative news.  So they always have a wait and see cash is king approached on a bluechip that gets hammerd
Brave man

Learned that the hard way, but thankfully only looking at -$70.  Gl, that sounds reasonable

semiconDONKters
my baba shares are doing just fine
When will MT volume spike?
Who here had BABA calls
Last chance grab icln under 28 Shit should get more calls? $33
The main thing WSB has taught me is that when people overexaggerate a stock thats mooning, or is a MUST BUY DIP, or anything like that, they are 99% a bagholder who bought at ATH and wants to break even and cash out. The other 1% is someone who has some weekly calls and are worried.
aapl 130 c‚Äôs printing
You‚Äôre a retard dude January is super bullish
Yep horse race ticker spam guys
Rofl China going after AAPL next
Baba calls
Already down 10% at market open. I just keep getting facefucked by BABA
Wait until it get to 215 and buy
BOINGGG
Dont ppl in China own BABA as well this seems like it hurts there own too
gonna use my ARK gains to genetically delete the autism out of my brain

I'm buying but I might be retarded
Bought 38 PLTR contracts on that dip
GO APPL GO
It's ok BABA, you go when the CCP lets you.
Way too many open calls on PLTR 30 for it to blow past right now.
Buying dips until I‚Äôm broke yes sir!   *coughs*  *pukes*
But let‚Äôs be real you could have shorted any stock at open and have a 95% chance of making money
Well it was a SPAC, which debuts around 10.50 due to the amount of cash they are holding. I think it could hit 20 dollars easy if people catch on
BFT ooga booga

idk when to sell this AAPL 132 1/8 c
Little manipulation on a low volume day haha not concerning imo
I lost 20k on BABA, I‚Äôm not gonna lie I thought it would be more.
Today half day and tomorrow closed yes?
What‚Äôre we buying the dip on?
Probably early-mid jan, hopefully before then

Imma be honest this sounds hella gays
Not very forward looking. Considering the moves they're making to implement sports gambling into the platform. I pay for Fubo/Spectrum and it costs less than  any Comcast or cable package out there with sports, at least to what's available to me.

If you're even thinking about touching Baba, it better be in SHARES only. While I LOVE the company, this antitrust probe has me a little concerned. I'd buy a little on every dip, and then be patient. It could be a little while until this rebounds.
Expiration date
sold ilikf yesterday at 2.22 and its now 3.50. that's soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo cool

I cannot believe I quit AAPL and it only lasted one day before I am back.
Bad idea. Insider share lockup expires next week. More dumping ahead
Buying this PLTR dip, I am in until $40
march is long enough that you should definitely hold
Damn it feels good to sell at the fucking top
After one financial report
Still not what I meant to do. Even less so with all of it on margin.
1/8
Can anyone here actually explain the mechanism for how quantitative easing makes it into the markets?   All the FED is doing is buying treasuries from banks and shoring up their reserves. Their balance sheet goes up, but no money was created, it‚Äôs just a 1 for 1 swap. To create money the banks actually have to want to lend out, and even though their reserves are healthy due to QE credit is contracting and they don‚Äôt want to lend.   Can anyone explain how Japan has done this to a greater extent and still failed to create inflation, yet somehow we expect it?   Paging anyone with more than 3 braincells.
It just crushed the other day I think
Ok, as usual, awarding the daily thread means my positions end green EOD, esskeeeetitttt bois!!!
GME Some peeps bought the dip!ü§ë
Ok Jack  Take me to Tendy Town please
Is it time for 0DTE GMEs?
If you didn‚Äôt buy the baba dip, you hate money
HELL YES TATTOED CHEIF !!  I LOVE INVESTING IN AMERICAN üá∫üá∏ COMPANIES   YEAH !!!   So happy Christmas Eve gonna make choco milk ü•õ üòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉ
i remember *my* first week here
"Santa rally guys santa rally" fuck these ppl
TSLA's market cap briefly overtook BABA lel
RIP BABA call holders   Rejoice AAPL call holders
Merry Christmas üõ∂  ,an early gift of coal.
Last December, China gave us COVID. This year, they decided to tank BABA
AAPL ath??
Maybe some ‚Äòinvestors‚Äô don‚Äôt want to wait till 2023 to see the first actual product roll off the assembly line......
Gme volume setting up for another ripper of a day
Was going to buy shares of BLNK ~a month ago when it was ~$8 a share, but held off. Sick to my stomach seeing it up to $48 this morning, fml need some rope
Pltr dead
GOEV has a little funny business going on with the price lol, some interesting bid/ask action but that‚Äôs what you get on a low volume day. Bought in literally half a second before the dip, thanks rh.
Simply having a terrible Christmas Time. Just kidding it‚Äôs wonderful
Merry Christmas to everyone except for Bitch McConnell, Nancy Pelosi, and the American government
# imagine panic selling AAPL and it does this the next day
BABA looking so joosy rn.
I regret putting a two factor authentication on robinhood. I don't need time to second guess myself.  If I lose it then so be it. Gotta input a code everytime I want to buy something
wait u fr

Anyone got any good $ROPE recommendations. Looking at some double braid, twisted, or Nylon due to its stretch factor it‚Äôs looking like the most comfortable fit
til about Q2 2021 when they merge, dw it will go back up
That is true. But if figured we should go easy because Christmas.   BUT YOU KNOW? FUCK EM! FUCK EM FOR PLAYING GYNA STOCKS. MUHAHAHHAHS
BLNK ü•¥üöÄüöÄüöÄ
Once again I should have played AAPL but didn't
Well at least NWARF is showing up in my account again. Although the valuation is still all fucked up
Net ready to pop off
That was funny indeed, thanks
I mean it‚Äôs just flat AF since that 10% jump last Tuesday.
Anyone looking at $VIAC ? I‚Äôm bullish on the investor day in early 21 it could be the same kind of event driven strategy as Disney Investor day except VIAC has a $20 B valuation. Paramount plus has a bigger streaming business than HBO max by more than double and Pluto TV HAS DOUBLED their revenue sequentially. Worth a look. I‚Äôm LONG AF and looking to size up given the growth prospects and I love streaming. Made a fortune on Disney Investor day hoping to double up with this VIAC investor day. This is still not well known as they only mentioned it at the UBS event two weeks ago.
F
Nah wait till it becomes BARK. What a great ticker
SQ died
Only a bit more and I am not down 10k
Don‚Äôt üëèforget that üëè ICLN is a beast and is just starting with Biden
BABA bagholders crying
VLDR, LAZR, PLTR, GOEV and XL fucking me today.  TURN IT AROUND BOIS
XL to the moon
GME bulls said not today bitch
TEZLAGREEEEN
I bought that PLUG dip
The market can't close fast enough!
Thanks for the dip paperhands. Loaded up on calls!
Well they dont need to blindly follow just because hes been right/lucky for a while.  He isnt some kind of wsb prophet, just gives him a licence to pump and dump..
Not trying to flex or anything but I am now a proud owner of one share of $BABA
UK, EU agree post-Brexit trade agreement
TSLA hasn't done shit since in spy. Its needs to pump spy lets go
Santa's elves in shambles
Cheapest you‚Äôll get imo. Last week at 25$ was the right time to buy the dip
That‚Äôs a spicy meatball!
Ban
Poooots!!!!!!
thank you for the cheap NIO for Christmas

Bought STIC at 19.20 and it immediately died. Dont care because BECKY will take this thing to 50
GOEV giving me the middle finger for Xmas
I hope they paying you 2x
Haha...this....like, really? Of Tesla? Wow you're rolling deep.
GME $22 OR DIE TRYING
Yup. I used to pay for directvnow when it was $35. I've known about fubo tv for quite sometime now as I'm a cordcutting expert. Basically got everyone I know set up with the OTT stuff after I took the plunge about 5 years ago. Best investment I ever made. $2k a year in cost down to like $800 now per household. More $$ for stocks.
Idk why people even care about temporary dumps, every dip gets fuckin bought it doesn‚Äôt even matter
I'd go double braid, nylon didn't work for me
Who are they merging with
Would theta decay be an issue for a June-dated call?  The stock (HD) is up but my contract is losing value. I shouldn't have to worry about decay already should I?
Enough of the BABA posts alright. We all know jack ma is a certified vegetable, watch the video of him and Elon in a discussion.
where the fucj is apples top
TSLA pleas fly again
LGVW is absolutely ripping
Whenever I place a limit order that fills right away, I think to myself what a chump I am for paying retail.
How do you not hate yourself when you sell at +150% instead of waiting till +200%?
Bought some BABA just now on the dip.
I just sold some puts, so the worst thing that can happen is that the stock is below the strike price of my puts where in I'll have to buy back the stock at the strike price of my puts right?
Wtf  Im half asleep and didn‚Äôt think I saw that correctly
Haha. In light of BABA's decline, just trying to keep it light.
I changed my mind - bought some RMG.
That‚Äôs a pump and dump but PLTR is coolü§°üò≥
Andd Christmas is ruined this year
Oh no Pfizer babyyyy what you doing
This is clearly an over-reaction.  It's a probe, not an official lawsuit.  Google, Amazon, Facebook, MSFT, Apple all had a probe scare a few months ago....all at ATH right now.

Yeah that‚Äôs scary but tbh not a bad trading strategy. Short everything at open and sell like 30 sec later. This market is so fucked
&gt; ICLN  Personally think its overvalues now, had a good run up basically on Biden hype. If Dems don't take senate I'm not sure how much clean energy related spending he'll be able to get through the senate, chances are republicans gonna block it
All these contracts and pltr doesn‚Äôt do shit. What am I missing?

You guys mad at Tesla for not moving, lol. Me and several other people said for weeks that when it joined the SP it was gonna behave more like a normal stock without the huge rips and dumps. Now you‚Äôre mad because it had a slow dip and isn‚Äôt ripping back up. I haven‚Äôt looked at it since last week but this might be its price for a while tbh
Pfizer makes viagra. That alone should make it go up
Would the CCP really kill one of their own like this? This looks like a yuge opportunity

Me and you both brother.
It's not like Luckin disappeared forever. They are available to be traded today if you wanted to invest in them. It's just the fact that for several months no one has any idea what happened to the company once it got delisted. While the chances of that happening with BABA are low, you just never know 100% with China. Baba is China's biggest and most valuable company and they are treating it like Kohls. I would not put limitation on what the Chinese government is or isn't willing to do. Fact is these oversea regimes can be brutal and unfair in the way they apply law.
They already did. Today just 1 million shorts need to cover. We are at about 1 million volume. Rest of the day flat or red.
CHWYYYYY YOU BASTARDS I TOLD YOU 115C 12/31

Holy fuck BABA. Anyone else find it funny how when they announce the same investigations here it doesn't affect the tickers whatsoever yet when China does it they plummet because we all know China means business and it's less of an investigation and more of a "dicking down",

PLTR is my biggest disappointment :(
GME 15 EOD
use faceid
close them fam
hope u gotta stop loss because that thing went from 20-&gt;12 (about 40% drop) in 1-2 days.
TSLA back to its week high ladies. 670 by the 31st
So is this what the stock market looks like without mass manipulation?
So smart to buy after a huge cap drops that far in a day
TSLA just broke 650 here we go
Baba will be back at 250 in a month. Don‚Äôt care what CCP says. They won‚Äôt discourage foreign investment in China. Everyone wants tendies. Even communists
C'mon JD take advantage while BABA is in jail. Rise, RISE
i just wanted to hear from my friends and not some strangers article
I'm a triple retard... not only did I sell MRNA calls yesterday before the big rise missing out on 6k. I bought BLNK 1 days calls with it and then sold my BLNK calls for 500 bucks loss yesterday thinking it'd never recover... they would've instead net me a thousand bucks profit if I kept it till today
How do you sign up for the email alerts?
Isnt it supposed to be hibernation season?

Damn I feel like that scene in big short trying to get my stimulus check.  ‚ÄúGive me my money. Give me MY fucking money, you mother fuckers‚Äù

PLTR recovered nicely.   You can go back to mooning now.
I'm at 14 average...gonna hold until the next pump
Only cocaine Mitch
Yeah bought some shares at 226 just a small amount. don't have a previous position in BABA. Betting its gonna be a slap on the wrist and BABA recovers by 30-40% next couple of months
Unban u/SIR_JACK_A_LOT ya wankers.
Fucking guy betrayed us.  Held shares, posted positions in STIC and made a killing when us tards made it shoot up 20%  What u expect
is ABML still a good play?

PS $40 by summer of 2021. More remote work, more training classes online. Changes in certification exams (Solar winds security updates and new training classes) re-examinations coming up, needs new courses. Pluralsight is fairly common and used in tech and non tech industry.  My DD has been hearing people at the dog park the PMP exam changing and needing to sign up at HR a bunch of people for courses at Pluralsight. So I started looking into it...after 5 minute of in depth research, my retard brain said buy.   So I bought calls on PS and also holding onto GME  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  and PLTR  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ

Anyone else hate trading? I make okay money doing it but I just can‚Äôt stand it
I don't quite get why it is trading so high I thought it would be like a long term investment but I am actually so tempted to sell now

People really tried to make ICLN red üòÇ  It‚Äôs literally free money
everything's up. I don't think you picked the only one.
its been floating around 27-29 for the past week. why would you sell at the median thinking its the bottom? ü§°
The worse thing is that the stock plummets significantly below your break even price (which is lower than your strike price due to the premium you receive), and you start you new position of X x 100 shares down.   You can always buy it back if things go very against you.
Ugh why did I buy GOEV
Probably those foreign countries that where getting more stimulus than us
I‚Äôm kind of thinking the same, scoping out the option chain at the moment
I've got 40k to put in gme. Already put 20k in. Hesitant to put too much because we're up so much past few days
So, of last note, if vix rises but spxs only bumps up a little, no big deal, probs a little sell off is coming. However, if both start going vertical together, means shit is about to hit the fan. However, if both nose dive, it's a strong indicator that we're entering into a bull market

Guys, I know the market closes at 1. Take a joke you autismos lmao fuck
Yeah, based on their past antitrust "investigations" it could mean just about anything, just not anything that's based on the actual "law" on the books, which introduces massive uncertainty. Could end up being nothing or having some totally bizarre outcome. Not surprised to see the price fall this much.

Selling covered calls is the best. If it stays at 29 all year I will still triple my money.

It's already dropped an unreal amount for how big of a market cap it's got. It's more likely to flatline or bounce up then drop another 10%.plus iv has spiked already I'm sure

Nah but good time to buy? Was fubo

Agree, and thank you for posting. TDAmeritrade updated ThinkOrSwim so that the "NYSE closes in" ticker accurately reflects the early closing time today. We should remind all the autists every time there is an early closing.

Dont even think about it SQ
I'll just cry it's fine
If these 1 month out IWM puts fail to work again I‚Äôm going to close out all my big Dick gains and buy 100k of ours because this thing ripped 50 bucks without looking back once.
Pluralsight is legit a staple of the tech industry, and more and more schools are integrating it into lesson plans. Could definitely see it having a huge future impact, but doubling price seems almost unlikely for a company that trains new skills and still somehow went down during covid.
Should I sell my AAPL calls that are up pretty big right now for more ICLN calls? Or keep both?
SQ has support at 231 , buying the dip seems like a smart play
You‚Äôd be a supertard to not buy leaps on an etf

Gme bullish!
$FROG!
I think it‚Äôs way overvalued for now, but it‚Äôs a speculation stock, they could keep rising for a month straight, which BLNK has done, or tumble very fast. BLNK somehow recovered from the last dump and went even higher, pretty crazy
Can it really say that
Need more volume
Will you guys give it a break on hyping PLTR. Its catching hella resistance at the 29-30 range and will not break out until  A. They secure substantially more contracts  B. Prove some worth with vaccine dist.  I‚Äôm not saying to sell off. Just don‚Äôt expect those Oct style gains again for a little bit. If it can break out I think it goes to around $40 ish.
BABA tanks enough I‚Äôll just buy damn leap calls, the risk/reward is worth the YOLO knowing this thing is damn undervalued in an overvalued stonk market.
GME staying above 20 now?
Picked up calls at 1.40% down, sold at .70% down a few moments ago.   I don't know how much more of a spike we're going to get.
Nobody is as dumb as I was today. After PM discussions with a fellow retard, I thought it would be a good idea to bet on the veto-proof defense bill being passed by investing in a couple defense stocks. I figured that they wouldn't tank once mango vetoed since they were veto proof and were being forced through on Mon or Tues. Jan 8 calls on those companies actually, shockingly (but not really now that I think about it) tanked this morning and fucked an otherwise flat day for my "portfolio" (although that word sounds too professional for what I have.   Thinking about selling and starting over once I finish reading a few books on how to not be a dumbass in the stock market.

$35/share in one day? Surely that's an overreaction. Baba already stated they would operate as normal, and will comply with all regulations. People acting like it's going bankrupt or something. This is mind blowing
so what you're saying is if i had just got the coronavirus i wouldn't have tasted all this shit i'm eating on these 12/24 calls

Ok boomer. Let‚Äôs fire up the coal burners instead.

Daily reminder that PLTR has never, not once, turned a profit.
You drug your knuckles last night and are now bag holding, look at the volume.  I bought Ah at 15.80 sold at 18.90 this morning.  You have to be a LOT faster on these types of plays, you will learn.
TSLA 700 EOD
What‚Äôs your strike?
No impact probably good that it‚Äôs over but Britain is a non factor cuz they‚Äôre poor
Did that post talking about S T I C get deleted yesterday? Can‚Äôt find it anymore
how do we feel about MARA
I‚Äôm out at 18. The volume right now is fucking insane. Pump pump pump
You finally gave my portfolio the killing blow. Thanks CCP
I feel baba could either be an amazing rebound play or it could go down to 150. Don‚Äôt fuck with the ccp

Where is the BABA loss porn? European markets aren't even open. There is more coming. Lmao
Can I just remind everyone that fuck snapchat?
May be a good opportunity to spend some more margin on it next week.
Going to work for a start up. This IPO money is insane. Screw working for the government

my 1/8 132 calls are getting mixed emotions bro
this is well documented. they were both HELLA weird in NYC, and kind of fell for each other because few others were as mutually self-centered and deviantly autistic.

It's china. If Xi wants BABA will be nationalized and jack man will come out and say it's a great idea.

Reinfections are common given the opportunity [[1]](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/khsw6u/scientists_urge_concern_not_alarm_over_new_virus/ggo8qir/). Reinfections can be used to estimate anti-body half life for anti-bodies created by the vaccine. [[2]](https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/antibody+half-life). Reinfections can also be used as an indicator for B cell immunity, as B cell immunity created via a infection is the same as B cell immunity created by a vaccine. [[3]](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html). Yes, vaccines do provide a greater initial antibody count than a natural infection, but the anti-body half life is the same and short as indicated by reinfections. Bi-annual vaccine boosters are not logistically feasible.  If antigenic drift reduces efficacy rapidly, its a problem. Its not possible to vaccinate for multiple versions bi-annually. [[4]](https://twitter.com/trvrb/status/1340409968818671616?s=20). "Immune Evasion" can already be seen occuring in the South African strain [[5]](https://sciencespeaksblog.org/2020/12/22/covid-19-south-african-variant-may-be-worse-than-uk-variant/). Suspiciously, there are also 1594 untested and suspected cases in fda report for pfizer vaccine, in vaccinated group. [[6]](https://www.fda.gov/media/144245/download). The FDA also cleared remdesiver for EUA, and it wasnt okay.

Sold out of baba shares for $500 loss  I was literally thinking of selling yesterday. Fml
BABA is doing some impressive shit. Up 50% YTD to nearly flat. I'm in at 215 if it actually goes to flat
just keep a close eye on it for a few days lol. hopefully it gains a lot of cushion

Anyone else buying the BABA dip??
It‚Äôs out there man
üöÄüôåüèª
Lmao how are you losing money on AAPL. Buying puts?? Because if so you‚Äôre a madman
Sell calls from a different strike to lock in profit
Quick, I'm FOMO'ing with yesterday gains, FSR, GRWG, or IIPR best stonk for  autistic returns???
You call sell the calls for Same date that are above.   Like if you have AAPL 12/31 $140c you can sell AAPL 12/31 $145c (just made those numbers up).   It works because the $140 fills the $145 if it goes ITM. so you can do that at the top to kind of harvest from loss when you think it‚Äôs peaked during the day

If u had invested in BABA at any time this year, u would have lost money. What a massive dip... My condolences.
yeah it's been fucking insane I should probably just sell it but I'm retarded
TSLA volume actually looking real good imo, you bagholders might see a decent pump today but don‚Äôt expect the 10% days of the past
Same
nice dip on CFII. Loading
Can FCEL please drop like 20% today? K that'd be great.
Perfect opportunity to buy some monthlies though, this thing should fly in Q1
Why is Tesla ripping?
Tendies!!!!
Hope so. Sold some puts at 240 for 12/31 and 1/15 a while ago.  If it stays sub 240 I may end up balls deep in baba
my portfolio is more of a means of destruction rather than production tbh
AAPL keeps teasing a break out. Just fly already

Yo! Just said that below. Absolutely
Then don‚Äôt cry when the ponzi party is over

Remember when you were a kid and dug a hole some boomer would say you were digging to China?  Apparently Chinese boomers say the same thing and baba is digging to America.
If GOEV could fucking GO already that would be great
Hey Santa, wake the fuck up and give me some damn tendies
Big money interests need GME under $21 today

Really want to long Krispy Kreme
Someone tell Santa to take his rally and blow it out his ass

If Jack Ma would have kept his big mouth shut for a few more days, none of this would have happened. No wonder he was denied admission to Harvard 10 times.
Going to pick up BABA when it drops below $100
There are lots of stop losses that are going to be triggered at the open.
Honestly you get what you deserve for putting your trust in China üá®üá≥
The price has probably gone up since then and it didn't go through. RH has shitty fills, you gotta keep trying at the current price
Hopefully it‚Äôs not LK 2.0

Bro sports gambling is not happening before 2022. This market is so regulated it has nothing to do with streaming anymore. Insiders know fubo is very low on cash, look at their balance sheet. This may lead to secondary offering. Of fucking course insiders will sell after a 400+% runup
Umm added some march 250C.
And MMs fucking with stuff with no resistance lol
Bought BABA ‚Äúdip‚Äù ü§°üìâ
GME pls say sike
The way it‚Äôs been trending I do think so. However, I bought 4/16 because I think with Joe Budden coming into office will moon the ETF even higher. That green deal is juicy
when yates is pumping fcel so hard on twitter you just know you gotta be careful
man tried to get in on some tsm 0dte calls and it didn't fill before that shit took off, fuck me for not getting in on the ask price i guess
Bought some 2/19 Calls on BABA, am I crazy?
I don't get the allure of barkbox maybe it's because I'm not a dumb basic bitch. I can see retard strength pushing the price up though

Why is PDD up biggy today?

Sorry guys I bought AMD, it‚Äôs only going down now
Rip baba, too red for christmas
PLTR 30 COME ON
This sell off is so gay
Fuck no I wanted to buy at $280 but so glad  I didn't pull the trigger. China lies cheats and steals like no other, fuck them and I feel bad for Chinese bagholders this could end bad.

TESLA? IS THAT YOU OVER THERE?
will meade twitted that mara filed for stock offering. i read couple days ago
I don't think staying in BABA is the best play. CCP already stopped ANT's IPO and has not been afraid to flex on businesses. Also, the market is already hot with JD and PDD gaining market share in that space. It's a little different than AMZN's market dominance in the Western Hemisphere; who's actually using WMT or COST's online shopping in the major markets?
most of the DOW is down. a risky (but potentially lucrative long hold is ba)
Oh no my weekly is expiring worthless how did i not see this coming

If you buy 30000 worth of shares your gonna bump the price a bit and that should make people happy, but what do I know
Can't spell "damn I hate money" without A-M-D
Not necessarily... TSLA would just have to make a monumental move today for you to make a profit.
Not likely to happen today. Low vol and markets closing early
Then you‚Äôre fine..the play is Q1
It definitely has more room to drop. All it takes is another news article from China and it drops another 10%. I'm probably going to wait until it seems like this China stuff blows over.
Fed suing them for opiates, such a joke.
HOW THE FUCK IS BEST BUY DOWN EVERY MOTHER FUCKING DAY
Yeah I am. I wouldn't mind a pull back to 18 or so I'd load up.

If that money is on shares, go for it.
I‚Äôm not a believer in max pain but total volume of call contracts that have been sold went up about 10x is this week.  It won‚Äôt stop the rocket, but it can slow it down... also it‚Äôs up an amazing amount in a short time.  I have faith.
Ya I got about the opposite of good play on them. Bought some slightly out of the money calls 30 to 45 days out (this was around thanksgiving/first of December) and they have dropped like 20% as a stock in that time. 100% loss on the options.  Great news hits my TV, their stock drops. I can't figure it out
Lisa for the love of god you need to get it together
This shit is retarded. Rallying for nothing like always. Goes up on stimulus hopes, then unmoved when nothing happens.

Welp. Sold baba at open and bought msft. That's an american play right?
Yes
Not poor enough to get poor people stimulus checks, not rich enough to get rich people hand outs :/
Proof? I don‚Äôt doubt it I just want to feel better about my baba call options loss

where
People here do not talk about fraud enough. On every bit of news or post we see, there is the risk that its an out n out lie. Right not now you might have a BS filter that works, but the liars will only get more sophisticated
Serious question, why would baba drop more (13%) here than in China (8%), aren‚Äôt they the same company and aren‚Äôt we going off of their news?
You could push it a little further out to February so you can play the earnings runup a bit more? That‚Äôs the call I have at least, it‚Äôs been going crazy lately though I did buy a couple weeks ago. I think you might be fine though, next week should be another good week for AAPL, assuming stimulus talks don‚Äôt go terribly. They should have more to run with new products, EV hype, potential that they‚Äôll smash earnings with iPhone sales
SPACs are ripppin

If all you retards think BABA is doomed just look at FB and GOOG that has similar lawsuits going on and in US unlike fake Chinese lawsuits. Algos will get you all so bad if everyone jumps in puts for BABA.  It‚Äôs AAPL of China and is up these in the big leagues. One anti trust law suit doesn‚Äôt mean their printers will turn off at all. Come next reporting period and it go brrrrerrrrr.

I traded some BA calls &amp; stonks on the morning bounce to the tune of \~$600 profit.   So, because I believe the next month until the Trump transition risk poses understated risk, I dumped the $600 into 1/22/21 IWM deep OTM puts.   Let's see if the tail risk bet pays off for me : )
Wrong answer. you really think the answer is in letters ‚ÄúGoogle‚Äù and not a time smh

Point being, we all know US trust lawsuits on big tech are bullshit.   China on the otherhand... There is a lot of risk still.
Guys you should watch Fox Business and buy puts on any stock they pump. They tried to pump SNE just now
You don't you just keep making worse decisions that's why the first ones always free
I can imagine it. My calls were down 50% and I just didn't want to dump more money in. These half trading days with expected low volume after a red day are easy pump days. Now I know.

Big changes are coming to GME. You might want to find a different non-volatile play but if you like losing money, that‚Äôs on you.
Sold TSLA too early :(
Feel like Baba could be the most epic long term dip buy ever but I'm not touching it right now. Will be watching it closely
Merry Christmas my retards. Love you all and stay safe out there! :)
If you don't own the position anymore why do you give a fuck what it looks like now?  Use that mentality. Look for the next play, not the play you wish you made.

Yea i could sense that cos it didnt make much sense. I probably would sound like an imbecile if i were interviewed in Spanish or what.
**TSLA**
Below 50% IV is good for large cap stocks. Its way better than tesla. + chinese regulation is swift and decisive. Everything looks priced in already after this massive drop. Baba is almost at at its 1 years ago level. Good risk reward.
Just now?
That‚Äôs like being just an observer at an orgy
My guess is an 11am power boner for GME. If not 11, then 12:30.
Ok...but we selling before close right?

Really? Fuck. I thought it was just down because of normal trading shenanigans. Hopefully I got it on the dip tho.
I dumped a bunch around 645. It just now made it back there. You can always buy back in. :-)
Guide to diamond hands on GME: don't be a bitch and zoom in only, zooming out are only for pussy boomers from /r/stocks. You see dip you buy, we work towards 50 EOY retards
Yeah I agree with you.
I hope it does, crazy volatile.
228
TSLA 670 EOD
Won‚Äôt This drop the price?
I have a gambling addiction
Su Bae what is this piss poor performance ? make AMD fly ü™∞
BLNK jumping again today.
GME double bottom, BULLISH
atleast you helf your calls and didnt panic sell
W shaped graph for PLTR, FDs are GUUH
Ah yes, diminishing returns
So is my butthole. Getting prolapsed anus from all the deep fisting by jack ma, ccp, India and sec.
Np.a next moon mission spac?
Bft gonna give us a new bottom every day next week
Sir, this is a casino.  For real tho, who is listening to citron??
 Desending triangle on GME, full on war between bulls and bears rn. If it does break through to the upside, expect ~23 ish target. If it fails to, 18.50-19, and slow bleed downwards
Everything is up ... hard to differentiate. I look at it like this .. the downside is probably into low 40s or high 30s I don‚Äôt see it dropping more than that worse case scenario. There are a couple $50 and $60 Price targets from respected funds in the last couple days.  But the upside is definitely there - look at roku. If they can secure some good content deals or get into sports betting as they are planning to, this easily runs to 100. Risk Reward play. Perhaps play it safe with shares or longer dated options.
Holding shares at an average of $18. I feel good about the future.
üí©
Moving all my money into spac
Holy shit
May they still have Christmas tendies one day
PLTR going above 30, get in olnow or regret
Anyone going to Time Square for NYE celebrations?
To feel better about the AMZN dip I chart it next to BABA.
I kicked that shit to the curb.
that just means we‚Äôll continue to rally on stimulus hopes for another couple months

Friday is low volume I think Monday people will buy the dip pretty fast. I grabbed a starter position for FEB 255c and JAN 2022 $300c LEAP
MMs want GOEV absolutely dead lmfao
I hope so, I just got some 0-days for that strike :)
Guys I can‚Äôt tell who‚Äôs trying to help Amman‚Äôs who‚Äôs actually retarded. Am I retarded???
Literally buy calls we're closing green today it's Christmas Eve
wow i had great fun riding tsla to 650+, and then thought it should drop down since s&amp;p was the only news that brought it up 70%. guess my dumbass was wrong :/
G H I V  mad strenght
I love AMD as much as the next guy and made a lot of money off it in the past. That said I really do think it‚Äôs going to be flat for quite a while, like months. 2 of the worlds largest companies have both said they basically will be making their own chips moving forward, and they absolutely have the money/resources the buy the talent necessary to do so.  That‚Äôs a lot of potential lost revenue for INTC and AMD. I think theta gang wins on AMD for a while.
Lots of selling. I thought maybe it had short-term support at 230 but nah.
You should feel great about that, but you‚Äôd be up 750% if you bought options.
A good flashlight. Surefire or Streamlight. Don't know you need a good light until you have one.
All I hear is blah blah I am a bitch blah blah
One can dream! üöÄ üåï
Qqqj calls keep bleeding
I thought they agreed but Trump wanted to give us all more tendies
Thanks APPLE üçª done for the long weekend! Closing out green

I am seeing the BABA entry point soon.. fucking risky tho
FCEL has been an interesting ride. DOE interest should make it fun for a bit.
Wish I timed it better but this is fine üöÄ
You guys are such pussies, if you sold on most stocks you‚Äôre going to be crying after Xmas. Just hold and watch shit go higher not hard, stomach the red days the dip gets bought up
Honestly the market is just algos fucking with retards that know will buy high and sell low. And that includes me
This is going nowhere. There is no santa rally. All of it was bullshit
Anybody have any good autistic share buys? FSR and GRWG looking like top candidates.
Stop loss at $28 on pltr. 5 min chart shows a nice little bullish reversal. If it fails there, I‚Äôll wait another day to hop in
Yaaa my calls not doing so hot
The best Dip for 2020 is BABA. don't miss it
has to break 29.2
ew. my condolences
If you bought and held leaps from March you'd be up 7500% from March.
IM NOT SELLING
I would love to see the Grand Canyon some day. My biggest returns have been NIO, TSLA, SPCE, XPEV, and PLTR. Just been lucky enough to buy when they‚Äôre hot and sell before the drop. I‚Äôm in on ARK (all 5) and TAN now and just gonna let things coast up.
BLNK and you'll miss it! Paper handed myself out if like 40k by selling calls at 300% instead of the 3000% they're at now ü§°
Because of the -4% yesterday? Where do you value them?
Tatoo chef great long play
Anyone else getting killed today?
Buy the dip
how sure of that are u
Elon wants to do a deal with AAPL. Mark it.  TSLA and AAPL going to Mars. Literally.
Kinda weird to get my dad underwear lol
I'm 50% on the year and feel good man, you should be proud, you outperformed a fuckton of people and hedge funds. S&amp;P is up I believe like 15% this year, so yeah, you did good.
Need a yolo
It‚Äôs an abusive relationship. Not sure how long longer I can take it.
Definitely. Although learning options could be monumental. I‚Äôve done the exact opposite, no shares only options, and am up about 450% since March.
Elon, give me another push. Just get it to 670
Remember last year when Mango tweeted out on 26th that it was the best e-shopping holiday of all time?  My PTON, AMZN, and SHOP calls hope for a repeat.
 Rip BABA
For real.  Cannot believe those Kentucky Fried Fucks reelected Bitch McConnell.

2 week out baba calls still expensive
It looks like market doesn't care about Brexit deal done
Butt Plug
My Baba shares are down 25%. Should I sell or sell other shares to buy this dip
I‚Äôll load up if it reaches 215
I like it, thank you!
I got 300c for June
He don‚Äôt drink coffee and just threw out half his sock drawer and bought all new socks.
All them people but no bathrooms !
i hate buying puts but i'd rather be throwing knives than catching them and baba is free money atm
You guys ever talk to your stocks?
Hmmm....how bout that NKLA dip?? Thinking about bagholding for an autistic pump loll
The big three state corporates that betrayed China and transfered their ownership to a shell capital overseas. Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent.

My father said the same thing before $T fell off a cliff like 20 years ago after the government skewered it
well pltr was green for like 2 seconds
I‚Äôm mad I didn‚Äôt buy FL  I fuckin liked that company when Cramer talked about it like a week ago too
Bought the dip on baba but it‚Äôs still dipping
merci bohcoo
Dude, how??
I‚Äôve bought too much BABA. AMA.
$TSLA about to rip higher :)
QS about to take of üöÄ
For the long hold, it is easy money.
anyone else feeling a huge selloff about 5-10mins before close?
BLNK turning the thrusters into overdrive
We close at 370
Can you update me when/if I should buy please. I want to be cautious with my last play today. No day trades left. $435 in account remaining to use right now
BABA a falling knive. Puts are free money imo.
Loading up
oops
Dems are having a field day with the GOP infighting lmao. Trump burnt him and the GOP with him
Get him a air fryer or something
Who the fuck buys stocks?
Nope, MM not going to let ptlr hit $30 today. I'd be surprised if it holds $28. Definitely hitting 30 next week though.
I think PDD too. I bought a few Jan 170c yesterday on a alert for 200. Their like quadruple todayüòÇ
Same. I thought the MSFT news was seriously bad for chip makers. Not immediate effects, but it shows a trend
That was yesterday news.... today GOP blocked the $2000 stimmy bill
Freinds?
Wth
Sell your BABA shares then rebuy them since a lower average looks cool and you get tax breaks for securing losses
[deleted]
Sq goes up every single day until I buy it lol ok
Just rage bought AMZN as a revenge move on BABA
Yeah i yell at them to go up, but they ignore me
Fuck you thanks
BABA at the bottom finally
It will go down big before Jan 15 lol  Someone's gonna go after it again
Stld only goes down. Fuck my calls apparently
Oh fuck BABA has left the chat and banned himself lmfao
Waiting for the Trump Merry Christmas ya Filthy Animal tweet to rug pull this fake market
Okay Buddy you can do it
Get out of BABA now, shit has been bad since last week when they found out that its app is spying on people
üíéüíé &gt;!GME ICLN BB TLRY!&lt;  üíéüíé
Correct
You'll prob regret paper hands rn
Yea i said caonima to BABA
so buy calls?
So I shouldn‚Äôt have jumped in to cleanenergy at $8.50, guess I didn‚Äôt buy the dip.
GME üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
Trump doesn't need to sign the relief bill. He could absolutely avoid getting his veto overridden by not even signing it at all, and letting the government shutdown by Monday.
Fuck Amzn and NIO today
The idea of PLTR suddenly ripping seems like a fantasy
No thanks!
Yup great time to buy
Baba loves to bleed. We'll see, I think it could head for 200 over the next week
They‚Äôre called europoors for a reason
Im holding the same SPACs, any thoughts on an exit price?
I would, but can't trade options on them :(
TSLA 670 by 1200 üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
This is why I never use TA for selling my TSLA covered calls.  TSLA defies logic. I stick to Dr Patel‚Äôs advice.  Always set TSLA weekly strike at $200 above current share price. Used this method weekly since May. Guaranteed tendies and shares never get called away.
my sq and aapl calls have canceled each other out
not worth it with this IV
Literally my life rn

It's close to YEAR low...
Give me a 0dte
QS  üåöüöÄ???
holy crap gme has the potential to hit $25 today
This week has just been GUH after GUH after GUH. Santa rally my ass
Sorry I sold you my calls
Baba 220p. Made $50 big bucks.
I just want to see Apple back at ATH by end of year.
100
10 contracts AAPL 130c 1/29 bought in early December. Stay tuned fellas
Dips on thcb
I'm gonna bet we invested in different stocks.
PDD puts, will dip back down after the baba hype cools down
I‚Äôve been shilling this shit for days. Hope somebody listened. I think it‚Äôll hit $60 next week.
I sold a bunch of 670 calls that I'm regretting right now. This feels like last week when it hit 690
The CCP really hate Christmas huh.
That‚Äôs what you get for holding shitty Chinese stocks. All in America üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏

This is the way
[removed]
but papa only abusive us cause he loves us.
SPACers taking profits.  Give it a month.
Is Ghi.v rkt 2.0?
What‚Äôs up with SQ
I agree, but leap calls are big $$$
Its pretty crazy how 9-12 month out calls still swing 5-10% any given day even with the slightest of movement on stock.
Baba wat u doin bb
I had 5500 shares in July or so around $6. I sold them under $10 to ‚Äúdiversify‚Äù ü§°ü§°üî´
Who‚Äôs holding MGNI 1/15 calls? What‚Äôs your strategy? I‚Äôve been holding some 22c for about a month now and they are up bigly. Wonder how much this run has left in it...
The real reason not to sell: taxes. Push cap gains to 2021 with not having to worry about paying until 2022.
TSLA legit closing all time high
They blocked the increase from 600 to 2000  As they should, we've printed enough fucking money
Hold these aapl 132c that expire 1/8 or sell?
Honestly it's up to you. Personally I'd wait for it to bounce back and then sell but that might not happen
[removed]
Sad
China will never take over if they dont let their companies fuck them in their ass.
Why
Lol @ bark box post getting removed. Seemed like decent DD at first, that guy pulled off a 20% gain on like 1.5 mil in a day, you best believe he dumping at any given moment.
190-205 range
Baba
Yeah never gonna be able to time it perfectly. I bought at 226.  Basically if its just gonna be a slap on the wrist, it will moon back up to 300+  If not, then well you lose money regardless of what point you bought in today.
Why is SQ fucking me
190-205
gamestop short squeeze pls
Best of luck homie. Rooting for ya
Yeah I‚Äôm losing hope
Jesus Christ CRSR ahahahha I‚Äôve got stocks but at least do something
Called the TSLA rip lol
Jack Ma fucked around and caught some old school China shit.... get out if you can, they are the tank... he is the student.... this ends poorly
Algos just fuking us 12/24 47c holders
So what do I do with LULU
What‚Äôs your expected reaction?  Stimulus deal for USA is in shambles right now so if you were expecting ripping green then I imagine it would be muted by political wrangling but I could be wrong.
Nope. I bought 1k shares. Thinking of selling calls, but don‚Äôt think I want to hold these shares that long. Wish I could sell weeklies. Jan 15 is earliest expiry. What did you sell?
Stimmy going limp
Oh you said paper lol, I thought you meant üíé
Bought JD dip instead of baba
So what you guys think if a Gov shutdown happens... impact on SPY? Deep dive??   Took a small hedge on spy 305p jan 21!   Btw for the retards out there I don‚Äôt expect spy to hit 305 just more intrinsic value to far OTM versus close ITM in such low IV
Im on the train and people next to me are talking about how much money they made in the stock market. The top is in
son: daddy y no christmas presents this year  ? üò•  father: i'm sorry son santa died   \*(in reality he was holding baba calls)\*
Just hang on
Rookie numbers. Apha sometimes throws off all gainz. Perfect wsb stock.
I am pounding the table to buy baba
Someone tell me if a Chinese company talks shit about their government so I can buy puts on that company
This BLNK ride is unreal.  I just wish i had more than 1 contract.
What did you say about BB?
What did Jack Ma do wrong? Was he competing against the chinese banks with his company? In any case, it would be hard to break up ALibaba or hurt Jack Ma in any way cause that would piss off a lot of other people that are bringing money in China. I'd buy this dip
The volume on BABA. Damn.
[removed]
I hate fidelity. On a fast moving stock they always fill you at ATH
My 0dte would appreciate this
#IPOC pump it CHAMATH
Maybe those v bounces were the rallies
It‚Äôs not going to go down, but I will say it‚Äôs unlikely to do anything today. Once volume picks back up on Monday there should be fireworks it‚Äôs just a matter of what kind
Brexit deal went through. RYCEY to 100 EOY
I was so convinced baba leaps were the play yesterday
All that santa rally spamming for 2 weeks. U guys shouldnt breed
Went from 35 to 230 in a few months.
Load up on SQ chapsüåù
Looks like selling BABA calls at open was the right play. Second guessed myself but glad to be rid of it now.
BABA isn‚Äôt shitty
At least I‚Äôve secured 2 years of write offs this year :) fuck my life and fuck 2020 man how did I not make money this year
VLDR just ruined Xmas
Talk to them
I think you‚Äôre late.  Go read the recent news
TSLA you s3xy slut!
Dyslexia is tough though.  He probably meant QS
Day ain‚Äôt over. This shit box finishes sub 650
[removed]
Too late to buy into this today?
tesla doing the thing again!
Because a lot of motherfuckers are buying them thinking BABA will bounce at least a little bit.
Haha I minimized my risk over the weekend by selling friday, planned to buy the dip but paper handed real quick by buying in same price monday evening. Ah well, it's not like I'm q day trader anyways
Yes, but hedge funds and shorts out for blood after the loss they incurred from  shorting at 50 and shorting at 70. Homeless speed runners.
Yes. You have put in no work whatsoever and you've had solid gains
Still 4 trading days left of the year
Yea it might be the time to enter soon. I bet CCP did this so that they can buy some shares. Baba is too big to kill cuz it‚Äôs a money maker for them .
I loaded up on shares at 214 in April. Then reloaded with 400c LEAPs when it dipped from 319 to 290. That's sitting at -80% right now...
I don't think I'd buy BABA until it hits like 150 or lower. You guys realize China isn't the US, right? They will just fucking destroy the company if they want to. Insanely risky.
Qqqj what the fuck bro why so flaccid
Weekly?
Is stock market open today?
Thankfully sold my calls when stock was Around $20. Looking to enter sub $18
Those meme stocks were crazy this year. Glad you could make a profit on them.
Good time to stock up on FCEL?
Good ole Melon sneaking up his price while everyone looking at China.....
AAPL 133 gang
Like oh shit pull out?
True but risky as hell
Just think of it as investing and on ya way
buy leaps on RKT now
Robinhood starting to slip up
yep i bought those lol
Anyone else having the worst fucking week of their lives? Maybe it‚Äôs cuz I‚Äôm Jewish and this week is Christmas but Jesus Christ this is the fucking horse shit!
Imagine not buying fubo right now
Gme
However also should have bought the 220p 0dte I wanted to as well but figured why turn a losing play into a play at risk of losing more.
Lost almost 6K in 2 days after an over 25K run in 3 months.  Merry Christmas Congress
That‚Äôs my golden rule. Don‚Äôt buy puts. You can hedge with vixy calls
i haven't held a put overnight since march so you do you, but i am not touching this until it is under 200
Here's your entry point. 227
We just riding the brexit trade deal rn, this is going to fade at this volume
Yeah then you pay under that very cool joe Biden tax plan
Can Papa take us to the 700 promise land today
What if big stonk is mooning because Chinese competition just took a small slap with chinas gov quick scoping baba

I hope the GOP lost senate seats in Georgia   Clowns ü§°
Why is no one talking about BLNK jesus
I bought , fuck it
SQ kick it in reverse for thirst please.
So I should have really bought BABA puts at open üò≠   Congratulations to those who did üëè
I rolled over in to March calls earlier this week.
Wtf no $2000 stimulus check??? F u republican cunts
Ok I was worried with iv. Seemed a bit high
Most in here do. You'll.sell.your left but for 10 grand if you could
Thank god my baba calls are leaps Jesus
I was debating on being dip yesterday but held off
Real expensive to buy a 75c but I believe it‚Äôll keep going up
I hope MT prints next few months.
This is wallstreetbets not wallstreet low risk bonds
Trying to give us s3xy Xmas presents early
Feel free to just use the term ‚Äúcalls‚Äù
They were free money but after it‚Äôs already down 30% from October? Doubt it
PLTR swinging like a pregnant bitch
Could TSLA go 5% today?
Gyna is asshoe

Hold till next week
What the fuck is this pos trying to do
Alibaba is the biggest piece of shit stock ever
Buy the dip
The great BABA war has begun.
Don't take my word on it tho nobody knows how the stock is going to move
It‚Äôs hitting all time high before close

Sold GME 0dte for 33% gain. Jumped into some Tesla 0dte 670c. Butthole is puckered
PLTR swinging like a pregnant bitch
I am never buying SLV calls again.  Tired of riding that motherfucker.
More likely to be MVIS
they bought tidal
I didnt have previous position, I bought in at 226. I'm betting itll be slap on the wrist. Hard to call it to be honest.
I don't have the numbers other than what RH is telling me, but MCFE $25 2/19 also up big today. Someone betting on cybersecurity market
Papa Elon, will we see 700 today?
I‚Äôm poor to begin with so there‚Äôs that
How long have you been a member of the communist party!
This dip is just getting started
11%
GOEV about to rip
If i had some cash id invest in baba but gme ate it all
BABA really ded
Invitae actually has a very simple business: they extract your DNA and tell you what your gene sequences are. This is going to be a necessary first step in just about every new medical breakthrough so they will sell a lot of kits. On top of that the knowledge you gain by analyzing a database of these gene sequences will be immensely valuable.
While I don't know for sure, I am fairly certain they won't destroy companies when they already have some financial market issues under the surface
Spoke too soon.
Buying the dip on xl was a mistake
hmmm not a bad move bossman.
ALIBABA KEEPS SINKING WTF
Source?
Who‚Äôs still in STIC ?
GME won't stay above the VWAP.  I'm out have a merry Christmas.
guh
I started playing with it in July/August... Had maybe 2k between 7.5 and 17.5 calls expiring Jan. Seeing meteoric rise last 2 weeks or so was waiting for a dip that has yet to come to rebuy in.
Do we think IPOC will crank to $20 by Feb??
BABA$ DUDE HOLY FUCK!!!!
Puts on GME. I ordered two games and those motherfuckers sent a completely different game and forgot to put the other game in the box. Truly retarded
Held it since it was $9 bucks to $70 bucks lol. I love $SQ but sometimes it needs a breather!
Good bot
Opened +600, now -100...fun :D
LGVW and THC B man what are you guys doing?
Dude. Fuck jack ma. Little squinty eyed fucking mushroom
It's a bit harsh... $8 maybe $20-28... lol
You guys seeing how manipulated BB is
Retard
Apple is being such a tease
I'm about to do the same man. Fuck this bs.
Sir this is a casino
Limit bro
Damn they killed Jack Ma....
Time to load up on Baba. Nice dip for us
O A C
All the NIO winners are dumping into TSLA to avoid a BABA
Patiently waiting for the BABABottom
Nice.
always
The one day I invest in gme is the day it doesn‚Äôt moon, can‚Äôt complain too much
Yep.. guh
It's going sub 200...
Because it‚Äôs step brother FCEL has more room to grow. (Also cuz I‚Äôm pissed I sold my calls at 137 on Monday
Nio holy shit bro
Open is up over 4%, how is that on sale?
Unless these COTY calls print I‚Äôm taking off for a couple months to build up some more capital to lose in a week, getting nowhere off the small sums I‚Äôm feeding the market rn
fucking jack couldnt keep his dumb mouth shut
BABA free falling
the sus part for me was only responding to 2 comments, both times saying like "wow this shit post is having an impact? haha"
Man, that poor BABA 1/15/2021 yolo guy. All his other YOLOs were really good. This one was too, based on the Nov info. F
EBay you PoS
Ill look into it thanks
I expected the market to not be flat at least with the deal is done. The marker is flat the whole day
This was fully expected.  &amp;#x200B;  Unknown yet if mango man will veto it, which means delays in getting the current one out plus potential gov. shutdown.  Merry fucking xmas, gov't employees.
You seeing something I'm not? Not exactly blasting  off    Yet...
Real shit volume today
BUY THE SQ$ DIP
#China is ass
im down 3k today
Cmon Elon I want to sell the top go back to 660
Anyone buying BABA dip?
I have been talking about BLNK all week
Ik too poor for multiple things do I take a profit on my gme 23c 4/16 got it for 212 worth 548 kinda want to buy some shares in gme and aphria

You right that‚Äôs too far. Let‚Äôs get back to making autism jokes
Wait 20m
I need my AMZN calls next week to save my BABA calls to break even. Dangit!

I'm an old school Assassins Creed fan, been playing since day one. I really haven't enjoyed the recent games, starting with Syndicate, but especially Origins and Odyssey. I'm a completionist, so I still force myself to 100% them, but I'm not happy about it. It's a sickness.  What do ya'll think of the new one? It's on sale this week and Daddy needs to treat himself to something. Calls on Valhalla?

Imagine not buying calls on Chinese small caps right now. They mooning because BABA being broken up
Ain't done dipping
WTF Baba üòí
Ya wtf...
Is CRSR doing the same garbage it did earlier this week where it goes down to $36 and them skyrockets to the $40s? I just gotta remember that its next earnings date is Feb 8th.
thank you for your service
So SPY gonna give us a nice Christmas or pull the rug in the last 5 minutes like yesterday?
So much fear about Chinese stocks, tencent down 5%. Great time to go all in
BABA literally has no buyers - it's terrifying to watch
Damn Baba almost completely wiped out gains from the entire year
You could have literally bought just about any put on BABA yesterday and made a 50-100x bagger   And here I am... holding PLTR
Imagine buying 220p BABA yesterday for a penny.
Look at look the LMND's chart and volume before the middle of November and early. Now look at the chart $EVER and realize its fully recovered from their CEO kicking the bucket.
killed by baba
John and Pete najarian fuck pussy don‚Äôt they
I imaging this is what being raped feels like...
by who? Lmfao

Honestly, I think you'd make more doing that with PLTR. It's so much more predictable. Morning 5 min moons, then sell off in next 15, followed by day of slow recovery. Rinse n repeat every day.
lol https://i.imgur.com/GjOpq5o.jpg
Everything is dead over here in NVDA land. Volume is abysmal still I guess another month before a breakout toward PT
How is SPY still mooning? Literally every stonk on my watchlist (boomer, tech, and meme) are dropping like yesterday's close
technically not a leap if it's less than a year out, but very nice work. you get the 1/22 exp or earlier?

Hey man, I‚Äôm so sorry to hear that. But happy birthday! I hope this is the lowest point for the year ahead of you. You‚Äôll get it back. Don‚Äôt worry bro. Have a great rest of your day

Yesterday someone said you‚Äôll never see FUBO below 55 again. It‚Äôs down $10 since. Oof.
Will PLTR break out now?
GME wedge down forming. Get out of those calls
We‚Äôre closing above market close from last Friday (695)
Jack Ma was forced into retirement by Xi because he was taking up the spotlight and taking away power from CCP. But to prevent a power struggle, they let him stay as Board Director. They thought installing an army puppet with strong ties to CCP would eventually help them finally fully control Alibaba. Instead, CEO changed sides and worked with Ma to make a shell capital overseas and shift all the ownership there. Ma then comes out of "retirement" and hype a super power fintech IPO called Ant Group, that is a big fuck you to Xi especially when it consists of CEOs from different state companies that are market leaders. So now there is a power struggle, because if Xi loses then Capitalism will take hold fully.
Real talk, real estate in CA/Bay Area or stonks?
Can someone explain to me why GameStop or GME is rocketing?
Something I'm not aware of for RYCEY?
God damn PLTR stop blue balling me, please give me one more üöÄ day so I can get out! I promise I‚Äôll be better next year

This is the reddest Green Day

And another fack pump, we go lower....
Baba?
No short interest or volume whatsoever . I really believe TSLA closes all time high
I don't think it will find support until $200, so I'd maybe buy under $205
No just hold it for a few years

Just going to accept today is going to be a -1% today and get on with it. Nothing to be done.
Nope
True story
Sold half of work horse calls at open would have made like 4k
Thank you.
Trump leaving govt shut down til Jan 20th there's no solution to this tantrum.
Let's goooo TSLA üöÄüöÄüöÄ
it was you who messed me up
At work until Noon. Only 90 more minutes of being stuck at this godforsaken hell hole
ARE MY TSLA 700 12/24 CALLS GOING TO PRINT???
Profit is profit
Falling wedge on gme?
Anyone gonna go in on BABA? Im at some family event someone tldr the investigation going on into them please, is it serious and could they be delisted or broken up?
Pls post
Is this the floor.. Baba..
I see it as a positive.    It might take some time to push through 21 but at least it isn't dumping. Might establish a new floor here.
Let‚Äôs go JD and SE
XL. Just got in.  Gonna go go go.
Still sitting at support at 227. I think this is a good entry for a daytrade I just don‚Äôt have any left üò´
Damn I got a debit spread 230/235 exp 12/31 how‚Äôs it looking?
You must have BLiNKed once or twice
Someone knows somethingu dont
I think its a little different because its not the us govt but the Chinese govt
Gores Holdings halted due Volatility Trading Pause
Pfe and bntx could litterally fucking cute death and still be flat as a boardüòí
What a shit day smh
Did I say hahaha. No
all this BaBa talk makes me want some soup dumplings
#All the ARK funds are drilling
China is different from the US. Are you so sure about this?
I love it, let it refuel a bit
It‚Äôs ok bro...you bought sq at the wrong time...don‚Äôt cry
We buying this BABA dip? Or is it a multi-day sort of thing...
Or lost 4K
Lots of meme stocks drilling today, corsair drilling my portfolio
Brexit.
I‚Äôm diamond handing these 12/31 135 calls in to the ground. Sucks
Actually Baba backs XPEV... Which was briefly green but still down less than NIO
I refresh the page and it goes up or down
Fucking 16% drop on XL from open - gg to any put buyers
[deleted]
Fuck PLTR
CANT CUCK MUSK
Some tickers i havent heard of, the only one i recognized was NIO
Nahhh GME pops $1 in like 5 mins
-6% on NET is the best gift ever, its my fifth time i‚Äòve averaged up
I‚Äôm looking for the next one too, PLTR or LAZR could be solid leaps this year, premium kinda high now. GE $10 calls picked up in March for 1/15/21 did very well. They were pretty much dead until early November üòÇ
Are you retarded? This is wallstreetbets.
FSR and PLUG trying to make something happen here
I feel you bro, boomer stocks aren‚Äôt sexy, but they are consistent
You mean roughly when GameStop releases holiday sales and shows they‚Äôve sold literally every single console they own? Okay I bet it‚Äôs gonna plummet
Safest bet is when it breaks the trendline from yesterday to the opening this morning. You'd end up buying much higher but you'll also avoid getting in too early.
They made that guy who made the post $300k overnight
I stand corrected - I guess I was thinking of the market in general, not BABA specifically
Who knows....only thing I care is that its going up. And if they did, then everyone will catch on soon
any NYSE tickers you can provide?
unless it just double bottomed, for the day at least
Christmas Eve baby lets go lose some fuckin moneyyyyyy
How clueless are you
How on earth is Zoom at 100B marketcap lmao
buy up the fubo dip
bought the baba dip. Politics aside, baba is doing a sound and healthy business.
Literally my favorite stock. Every time it drops like it did yesterday you just buy calls. It‚Äôs free money.
The most sideways stock I‚Äôve had since I bought at $29
RIOT and SQ just cancelled my Christmas.  All gifts going back.
Held after +30, held after -9, holding after +80...... diamond hands brother there is still more upside

Where were you when baba died?
Im antisocial
Riot with a casual 10% swing, too bad it's in the wrong direction
Maybe stupid but averaging down on XL
CLIMB TSLA CLIMB
Why do you stay in the relationship, if it is chronically abusive?
cause acquiring tidal is a stupid idea.
what‚Äôs the next day trade move
It's just cause Square is down.
This might be baba's biggest drop ever...bought shares and calls
That's what everyone thought the last few times it tanked. "285 buy up that dip", "270 no way that's a steal", "it hit 250 it can't go lower than this", and then this morning "I need to hurry up and get this for $235 premarket before it gaps back up"

Calls on macaroni noodle crafts

Yep. Im long srac as well, commons and warrants.  N p a as well.
Can you even call it dips anymore with BABA or are we just straight-lining to zero.
Not my position, just witnessing in absolute awe
rooting for you! hope a miracle happens
I sold 75% at 19 this morning, leaving my last 500 shares to the pump and dump gods

Can't wait to tell the grandkids I was a part of the great GME squeeze of December 2020.

Christmas is red and green, therefore we will have some stocks red and some green.  Enjoy your day
Thank Santa I got PRPL to cushion the BABA pain today
uppies pls
i‚Äôve got a 675 and 700 call in it expiration today
That‚Äôs because the fat is in the federal budget, not the Covid bill. If they start renegotiating the budget a government shutdown will occur.   Keep in mind that most of the ‚Äúfat‚Äù Trump complained about was in the White House‚Äôs budget proposal.
Shouldve dumped money into stic AH yesterday, is it still a good buy yall?
PLTR is coiling up below resistance. It‚Äôll pop any day now.
and baba
&gt;gme  i thought TA was a myth. smh idk whats real anymore
Long mate. Real long. Write puts, buy stonks on margin.
At 660, do you have the midas touch?? Any other stocks that you think are going to fail today? Thoughts on BABA??
in or out?

Just a dollar fiddy
&gt;Seeing as today is the EOW..... Jesus id have a nice Christmas.

I'm pretty sure AMD $100 is like the fabled MSFT $200
Don't catch a falling knife.
On the bright side, sounds like it can‚Äôt get any worse. Time to get off this sub, get out of your shitty relationship, and start saving your money again. Bluntly put, you clearly aren‚Äôt good at trading options or managing risk, so disable that on your broker. Life is full of ups and downs. This is a down for you, but you gotta get yourself together to turn it around. Merry Christmas
When Tesla rallies after red days it RALLIES. Plus we get the bonus of it being a holiday and news is relatively decent so chances are yes if it‚Äôs dated for longer than today.
I bought net for the first time yesterday
Don't hold
bullish
You lost money on GME?  Lol how?!?
Amd release a statement, say your chips cure cancer, say you know what‚Äôs in chic fil a sauce, anything idc anything
Yes, hold
Wow, IWM actually dropping as SPY goes up. What kind of upside down day is this?
How the hell did you manage to do that on GME this week? Lol
I‚Äôm in an abusive relationship with BABA
Get the fuck in TSLA now
Can SNAP run pls?
Trusting China, not even once.
Just woke up...F for baba gang
You can fix it bro, I trust you. Take this opportunity to improve yourself and bounce back hard. If you didn't already, break up with her/him man. I've made the same mistake of staying with someone for too long because love bewitched me, it may hurt in the short term but it'll be a massive growth opportunity for you in the long term.
$SBE  own the FB of charging network. (chargepoint)  biggest platform.

This. However still too cheap even factoring in that
Cloudflare‚Äòs real strength is during sector weaknesses. It might never pump like CRWD, FEYE, ZS, FSLY but it always keeps going up.
NIO is so stressful on red days
yumm....xiao long bao
Nah it just swings hellas, hold for a long or don‚Äôt play it
lol it‚Äôs dated today
XL just bounce Jesus Christ
TSLA is undervalued. Mark it!
When was the last time anyone saw Jack Ma alive?
Thanks bro... need all the help i can get

AAPL and TSLA to Mars in a Joint Venture?  It's Happening.
Sitting at support at 227 look for upward movement just in case it loses support
Yeah I bought calls earlier this week. My bad.
Damn I have lost A LOT (for me) of money today
I too like being drilled
They aren‚Äôt even down a percentage point. Chill.
And here is where SPY puts are peak value
If you have to ask, then yes
why is MRNA going down?  for awhile now
So much profit taking on LGVW
Facts. 1/3 my account in March call spreads. This is way oversold. The CEO of Alibaba is trying to lick XIs boot so hard. Plus, it‚Äôs worth more if broken up anyway ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  CCP officials probably buying in at better prices.
Took profit the put it back in

SNOW finishing at 330 today
All I want for Christmas is a $69,420.69 RH account balance
Hoping FEYE bounces off of $22 today and retests $25 next week
has to just be free money right?
Dude he declared it
i know some of you bought baba at 300. show us
Didn‚Äôt know the grinch owned a hedge fund
Yes my rycey will go up $0.02 toot toot
Ye@h i am dumb for expecting otherwise
Google it
What happens after a double bottom? Triple bottom lol
Wow MASS is on a tear, was gonna buy that shit on IPO day but it had already doubled before open
He lied to us
Imagine holding baba calls at all
Baba 50% of my Roth :(
correct
Total gamble but buying some nkla shares at these levels
FCEL getting nice and stable for one last rip up b4 christmas üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
Should I buy more ARKG even though it‚Äôs up 20% this month
Yup, sold my calls yesterday because I didn't believe. FML.  12/31 calls? Maybe some 750s?
except for the one that holds companies working on giving us wings.
you think 1/22 200$ puts are free money??? just wait until you try 1/15 140$ puts!!!
Why would anyone keep money in it.  Anyone with a brain dumped after the run
Screw it. I'm going for as much leverage as possible. It's the only way to keep up with inflation. Cashing out my 401k to buy TQQQ calls on a portfolio margin account using box spreads to fund my account and not witholding any taxes to maximize account balance.
Well Santa rally was a crock of shit
Do it faster.
Ofc the only tech stonk I have calls expiring today is taking a dump
Rag pluh
PDD calls were 50 baggers. Fuck fuck fuck      I was an idiot to buy leaps instead (2x on them)
bro just buy more on the dip,
Am I the old tard still going hard on DKNG? Everyone else just talking about GME and BABA
IWM all over the place
CRSR is one moody bitch
what happens in 2027?  did you come from the future to warn us?  WHAT DID YOU SEE?
Is m vis dead?
sell before lock up on 29/12. its gonna unlock alot of shares
LOL  Yes, the like 4 consoles per store. The low margin consoles without disk drives. Massive boon!!!

Mia
Baba -14%  Party City -4%  I'll let you do the math
Yes
Serious question  I bought some palantir shares at close yesterday and the price paid was 30.83 - what the fuck?? It's never even hit 30?? market order
Is it?
WAS TOLD THERE BE $GME SQUEEZE AND TENDIES??
As much as I like green, it‚Äôs the red that has the potential for tendies
God the red on my portfolio hurts.  Fucking FB ain't even helping fuck
well have you? once you do the top is in
shares? yes
No ones looking, it's going up...
I know some of you PLTR bulls didn't meet your quota of 69 rocket emojis yesterday and that's why we're not mooning.  Shame on you.
It‚Äôs a Christmas miracle! The NET calls I bought yesterday at the dip are printing. Merry Christmas retards!
new here. $20 a good entry price?
Guys buy BABA
Is nvax a dicey company?
Cant wait for GOEV to never be investigated for this pump and dump!
I felt this
I‚Äôll make this easy   **FCEL** is free money as it runs up to its biggest battery showcase its ever had jan 16 and It‚Äôs in their with the big boys like BLNK and sbe. This will hit $20 by then and I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll see another dip like this.. just want us all to have some Christmas tendies
and buy back after the dip ! you're welcome and merry christmas
Theta + my calls = $0
Blood
pleas fly again
Ow
is üêù any good to get in anymore?
coiling
So now we‚Äôre silent on GME, GME gang 1/15 Calls we holding strong through the new year?  Still think we might have a rally today? Anyone getting out today then hopping back in Monday?
TSLA flying again üòç
I want to go in BABA now. Pleas stop me
You gotta gamble those 0.2k away real quick if you want reddit points.
RIP in peace bro
I'm done with Chinese stocks. The Chinese government can literally do what they want and what they please, BABA can go to $0 if it wanted to. Sold my calls out of fury, have a nice day.
Why does baby grinch look exactly like Mitch McConnell
Baghold VALE $19c 3/19?
Listening to [China's National Anthem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UctriMuXYS0) as the CPC seizes my portfolio.
Fuck Chinese gov fuck communism fuck baba
Did you collect two of every retard?
Just got in Baba right now at 10:36. It won‚Äôt go any lower I feeeeel. Bless lord Buddha, holy Allah, Son of Jesus Christ, almighty Krishna.
Is PLTR breaking out soon or what?
That‚Äôs a cool idea for your kids, I always appreciated the trips and stuff my family did way way more than any gifts.    He‚Äôs a difficult guy, doesn‚Äôt like concerts or shows, doesn‚Äôt drink, doesn‚Äôt have any real hobbies I could get something for (besides golf which he buys himself everything). I already got him satellite radio for his TSLA so I just need something else to actually give him on Christmas cause he likes having something to open. I‚Äôm thinking something else for his TSLA like a trunk organizer or something idk. I‚Äôll figure it out lol.
Hey, at least they all could agree on something!
I bought a shitty condo for 390k worth 490-515k now in around 27 months. Nice zip code in Bay area.
are y'all really bullish on GME, like in reality?  Did you even listen to the earnings call...????
Happy Cake Day!
GME gang?üöÄüöÄüöÄ
I can tell you it wasn‚Äôt going to be at open üòÇ
What did you make of it when it was 50% HIGHER just a couple months ago...
Just dropped 100K on BABA. Overreaction to its finest. Let‚Äôs fucking go
Wooo go TSLA üöÄüöÄüöÄ
BABA has rage quit
AAPL KEEP GOING, I CANT AFFORD THIS LOSS  [https://ibb.co/n1CxKhd](https://ibb.co/n1CxKhd)

Aapl slightly elevated but not quite moon!
NOOOO HIT 30 TODAY
Doo it! I did.
Is it still a good buy? Missed jack alots post rip
Jesus MVIS
Kinda boring
Goev is pathetic. Shouldve sold it yesterday.
got a better idea.
Buying $440 calls on Baba expiring in 2022
Imagine asking that like any retard on here knows the future
Wtf GOEV
would have been tough to get a fill anyway
Hold or sell PLTR for loss?
My mvis calls are freeeeefallllinnnnngg
Big PUMP and DUMP.
It‚Äôs not a solid trading day unless my CRSR long gets fucked hard
[removed]
Melt up on low volume, got it
Dude no... lmao so many other plays out there
Brooooooo this hits different. PLTR 29c 12/24
Buy dip
they said gaming on CNBC..
DA hasn‚Äôt come through yet so probably yea. Depends how long you are holding for
I lost money on XL ü§°
Hope so, and I'm out of day trades.
i sold at 1400 shares at 18, back in at 17. Hopefully a nice rise to eod.
It's a distraction, go buy some other goodies...
how much would i. make off a 675 call expiration that‚Äôs today in TSLA, it only costed me 50$
Yeah, definitely. People are expecting a big boost Monday (it probably won‚Äôt be big but I imagine around $22 point).
Please slap me again lord elong
Volume has been steadily declining
Y‚Äôall really forgot it‚Äôs down like 8% over the last 2-3 days
Net is mooning like it‚Äôs 1969
Calls but fuck it looks like it‚Äôs being pinned down around 227
You gonna make BANK
Just barely hit my entry level on MVIS.
Just woke up god dam baba

We‚Äôll I‚Äôm playing 6/18 debit spreads
Don't worry guys Xi is totally cool, and rational he won't over reach and nationalize BABA.
I bought 2 shares at $220...and 2 more set for $215   Retarded? maybe but LFG!!!!!!!!
Free free fallin‚Äô

When do they expire
Share or call/put? Expiry?
Fuck it just broke support

No options. 700 stocks bought around 28.95
It's gonna dump soon
Its gonna take some time to read through all the details, hold tight. Details will emerge next 2-3 days.
The market is literally bear traps til the end of the pandemic.
Are bars open in DC?
Long term it should recover. I wanna buy options tho
JOE just keeps going up
Is PLTR hittin 30 today?
I just got fucked man I‚Äôm so sad
Reminder fellow small fish. RH will close out your options if you don‚Äôt have enough money to buy the number of stock one hour before close. Might see a dip around that time.   TSLA 670 by 1155 üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
People actually use market orders?
I could have sold yesterday at 700% but I wanted that 10 bagger.
Shares or calls?
Go back to bed
FLueNT? Thoughts?
That's what you get for joining hands with those fucking commies.
count your fingers
Hold your shares how are you going to paper hand this one
Saw that ark was buying surface oncology a few days ago so started to look at it.. They have a new deal with GSK that has potential for them to receive $700 million, and yet their entire market cap is less than $400 million. Am I missing something or would that imply that they are very undervalued at current price?
Gonna need like...a LOT of things to turn around today.
Gonna be a huge rip leading into its Jan showcase
Agreed. Avg down heavy here
Painful to own those shits.  However selling now is literally selling when there is max fear. Not a good idea

Dump that SHITSTAIN of a stock and put your money into VALUE stocks bro
Well, it‚Äôs twice as good!
Stop. F you CCP &amp; Xi.  Wait a week for dip to consolidate
[removed]
For real.
XL on sale. Was 35 this morning. 29 now. Due for a reversal.
rip your money
Buy fear on $BABA?  Let's assume Xi brings the epic commie shit storm of hellfire down on BABA due to Jack Ma?  Aren't companies often worth more piecewise than as a whole?  Investors in BABA will get shares of all of the spinouts, which is typically what happens when a monopoly is broken up, although I'm not entirely quite sure what happens with a Chinese company.   People who had AT&amp;T got shares in all of the Baby Bells after AT&amp;T got broken up.  It ended up being very profitable.
I predict more contract announcements leading up to earnings will be the breakout catalyst. People will realize the short term valuation concerns are nothing compared to the snowball potential.

Hold, then if you're ready sell when it hits 29 again on Monday. Shit's predictable at this point.

Those bastards lied to me.

They haven't even merged yet of course
Hold that shit. It‚Äôs not going anywhere.
Keep going on GOEV mms I got a lot more money to buy these dips
Are IWM puts free money or too good to be true? Seems like a prime short target
Fuck today. Happy holidays y‚Äôall

Are TSLA and ARKK inversely related or some shit lmao

RH will sell your calls automatically. So lock in your gains or let it roll
Just a big dolla fiddy dildo
Yeah, I was there and watched my hands turn to diamonds when it dropped. It's a massively shorted stock that is undervalued because boomers just take it as face value "blockbuster lol" and ignore that gaming as a market is booming and GME has a huge foothold and by increasing their offerings, service, ecommerce platform and brand they could turn things around massively. We just need young money RC at the helm to drive this spaceship.
My TSLA call I sold yesterday only up 300% today :(
Bought, join us on this burning ship so if it fails I don't feel as alone in my poor choices.
Feels good to be making money before the new year but I'm still shocked we aren't red af off of the news in Washington. Not complaining tho

A dip after inclusion was expected. A flight after the dip was not a given.
I would rather let these fucking options expire than let the MM's win and sell  EDIT:  Oh fuck that is exactly how they win....
So frustrating

I see y'all bought that THCB dip
Fuck $SQ really. Wtf is this bleeding? I exited my position
If what happened
what‚Äôs your suggestion lol
No. We can only crawl until the MM's has shaken out enough gamblers.
Did jack ma not bow before the supreme leader Winnie the Pooh as suggested by WSB?
Could also be worthless
I'm staying in for the long run
You got in too late
Yeah that‚Äôs why I said it hit my entry price. I got filled at $6 and it bounced back to $6.20 immediately. Just barely caught it.
Anyone else getting bent over by baba?
You and half of this sub.
It's china!!!!! Not the US, there won't be a break up it will become part of the CCP and jack ma will end up in a camp.

It‚Äôs the closest thing they can find to the world is ending
Yeah. Did you? Current management is already doing a decent job of cutting costs and refocusing on what makes money. RC will expand on that and the console cycle will be a catalyst for enormous earnings growth. As a multiple of revenue it‚Äôs trading like a short term bankruptcy risk, which it definitely is not.
It just ends up being invested in U.S. tech stocks or booze. The booze in Ontario is sold through government stores.

Got one at 17.10 just to remind me its there, going to average down if it dips. I see more short term downside, like BFT
Bof
BABA starting to flatten out. Preparing to start moving back up or continue to fall further. Stay tuned.
RIP
Yeah Apple might keep pushing today anyway the rest of the day so you‚Äôll probably be good. I‚Äôm deciding now if I wanna take the profit in my Apple call and roll it into ICLN calls
This is a long play. It‚Äôll grow huge next year
Every other day this week
When the volume on your covered call is so bad that the spread makes no sense so you‚Äôre down 1k and the underlying stock is down 2k. Logic.
Sure looks like it‚Äôs getting pinned at $29.
Cathie on holidays already???? Get back to work pleas
Is there any reason to hold my 1/15 GOEV calls right now...

I got out of PLTR because I was losing my ass so I invested yesterday in some BABA LEAPS assuming it was less risky. I feel like I won the opposite of the lottery.

why would you hold 0dte on GME please tell me you're memeing
Drops on robinhood look way more dramatic than it really is. Except for BABA that shit going to 50

TSLA TO MARS!!!!!! GET FUCKED MICHAEL BURRY!!!!!
FUBU up next
Sold FUBO at 34 yesterday.  Looking to get back in.
It was down like 8% before today‚Äôs move
Anyone selling covered calls on PLTR? Got tons of shares and am thinking this could be a good idea with how flat it‚Äôs been. Any thoughts?
?? Canoo is an amazing EV company that's been talked about for a month or so
I take it back I got scared
üíØ I think it‚Äôs oversold here. It sold off on antitrust concerns a month ago too.
Thanks, I think I'll stay on daily Riot Plays.
E O S E profit taking today...
Almost like 90% of ARKK is not TSLA
Citron got me twice,  once on NIO once on PLTR, for about 60k overall
How much you wanna bet this is just political theater and pony show for Baba?  Xi is flexing on BABA to show everyone never, ever fuck with the communist party, but at the same time, they don't want to scare the bejesus of out investment, especially into the tech sector, which is wear China is desperately trying to overtake the US.    It's a monopoly anal probe.  It'll probably result in nothing, but 'reform' recommendations in the end.  Just a big political show.
BABA is fine. This is maximum pain. They will fine and ease the handling, for they are buying shares right now. Communists love money as much as you do.
DONT.
I just rolled down the strikes on my BABA calls in some pathetic futile attempt to get just a little bit of delta in case this is the bottom.  I am like an abused spouse that just keeps giving my man one more chance.  It is just fucking sad.... please everyone avert your eyes.  üòîüòîüòî
THCB the ticker isn't banned anymore
The $8 Price target damage. The other price targets are irrelevant apparently.
Yes. They announced: declining YoY revenue, worse than expected earnings, increased store closures. Filed for a 100M shelf offering which they will surely be using soon. Good e-commerce growth but 300% of a small number isn't that relevant.  As a multiple of revenue it's trading like a shitty B&amp;M store with bad growth prospects lol
Don't buy GME dip. It won't be the last. I don't want to see you guys get hurt
for today! was down -4% on my portfolio, now -11% all time woo!
oof

Fomo is the one thing we're capable of perceiving that transcends dimensions of time and space. Maybe we should trust that, even if we can't understand it.
Yes but patience. Itll be a good short but too much retard strength rn
I'm experiencing the Xmas theme today, keep bouncing back and forth from red to green on the day.
With this spy dip FCEL has never looked so good. I mean seriously do not miss out my fellow tards
Cloudera ‚òÅÔ∏è anyone?
üôèüèæüôèüèæ
you bought after it went up 100% in a week?
cuz the market never cared about poor people getting checks
You will likely get a better price, once you place an order to close those calls.
I dont know what a spac is and at this point I'm to afraid to ask, and or google

Wow did baba puts fucking print
Fuck I should‚Äôve just bought more meme stocks
Don‚Äôt say I didn‚Äôt tell you about _____
it went pretty sideways from sep 2018 - mar 2020 as well. i guess covid gave it a huge boost but now its found its footing around 3K again
Always sell CCs
now i know not to - truly never had this issue before I guess I just didn't know - I feel like that's an absurd jump though regardless
Played PLTR perfectly this morn. Cashed out 0dte puts and turned em into call spreads.
That shit had zero chance of getting through the Grim Reaper anyway
Glad to see Baba take a shit after it absolutely fucked me and dumped a quarter of my account in one day in August for no fucking reason   Think it was like august 6 or 7
funny last week i posted blnk and plug, and my message got banned because blnk wasn't 1b market cap and now it is lol

But MVIS dip??
Agree to disagree
Yep this will be a good one once people realize that
Did you dump your entire portfolio into 0dtes?
This market is beyond fucked. I have March SPY calls that are dropping 3-5% a day with SPY fucking green.

I was excited last night to buy into the dip today üòïüòï
Give it up, BABA.  You're not going to stay above $220.
If it‚Äôs fucking stocks why would you dump it? Literally just hold it dumbass
Volume is so low only poor people are trading.
PLTR lost its rocket a month ago :(
If you‚Äôre not buying this huge baba discount, you‚Äôre retarded

Holy fuck I'm rich
Who was buy fucking puts?? It was at a 6 month low with insane fundamentals.
All I want for Christmas is for someone to buy my put spreads on abnb
I'm starting to sadly think that NIO is just this.. up and downs in the mid 40s but that's pretty much it.. probably not a great stock after all even in the long term.
LMAO WHERES ALL THE üåà GME HOLDERS NOW
Thats it im never touching spy again fuck this shit
i have $5 someone tell me how to make a quick 100

Short NKLA.  That shit will be at 0 in &lt; 1 year.
Just be patient. They are legit. Once everyone realizes it it will moon again to 80+ - double down if you can.
BABA leaps a good idea?
Unless the ones spun out become wholly state owned.  Jack Ma has already told Xie that the government can have any part of BABA it wants.
Yeah you likely got hit with the wash sale rule, look it up, they adjust your cost basis.
You thing SQ gonna go lower into EOD today or is this the dip? I can‚Äôt sell if I get in today üòµüòµ
short squeeze- it's worth more to prop it up and keep it flat than it is to let it drop it seems

IV on PLTR is so high that I just knocked 5% off my entry-price today by selling 7DTE covered calls against them @ $30.  Damn.

I was +50% on 30c that I bought yesterday morning.  Doubt I'll even be able to see these before the early close lol
Put 2k in GME April calls. You'll lose money 100%
Paid $270 for GME contracts that are now worth $15 lmao....
Ha. It is probably.  I've got a stop loss on it if that tells you anything.  You just need to buy everything you're bullish on when the market has a down day as a whole.  If SPY is dragging EVERYTHING down then buy contracts as far out as you can afford.  I've done it twice now and it's worked out great.
Whew that makes me feel better about my account today
You got it pal!

What would you guys think of buying BABA For 1/15/21 $250c‚Äôs right now?   I know it *sounds retarded* and it *is retarded* but the calls are so cheap right now I‚Äôm trying to figure out if I can afford **not** to buy them
Man that Tesla owners forum is toxic. We fight on here a lot but it‚Äôs all not serious at all. Those guys are actually beefing over whether the holiday update will be released on time.  Shit ton of fake news too.

hep(a) has a good dip right now
I flip calls non-stop. Would not short.
Hold all year free ten bagger
Is CRM just not going to go up anymore because of Slack? This is frustrating
Definitely
I-V-R. Calls were up real nice and meant to close them and instead bought the same amount I had and then BANG... whole thing went to shit.  Also lost a grip to TNKR. Fuck that gang.
I just need gold to make a quick $10 down and then I don‚Äôt mess with it again
Oh shit, I think STIC is making another run at it!!!
Jesus christ even puts 8 months out on BABA were at least a one bagger
Sounds like your mom needs some bwc
Ok seems like a good move. Hopefully it doesn‚Äôt go down too much..
Those fucks don‚Äôt take vacations lmao, they‚Äôre always trading while their wives boyfriends take their families on vacation

For all you retards that need to hear this, do not let the MM's and Algos win, buy the BABA dips. HODOR.
VXX turn around?
$279 seems so far away. sigh.
Wait for it to test 225 again, if it holds I‚Äôd buy, if it doesn‚Äôt it‚Äôll likely go lower.
Lol stop buying FDs if you can‚Äôt take the heat
Well, it can dump by 5% and I'll be fine. Or it can rise and I'll get exercised for profit. Or it can dump further and I can continue lowering my cost basis using covered calls.
Lots of foreclosures hitting the market?
fcell in beginning stages of its daily rip!!
What is going to lead the Santa rally? My money is on STZ, BBBY, and MU for earnings run ups for the start of the year. All consolidating.
If you're not buying call options in BLNK, you have to ask "what am I doing with my life?" Room for MORE upside exists
Buy $TSLA fractions near EOD so you can $ROPE on Monday
I feel like the fact that the CCP can come in and shut them down, or take them over, or do anything they want anytime they want, puts a cap on their value. But I'm an idiot. Probably smart to buy deep otm calls.
When Xi gives BABA his blessing do you think it will just gap up 30% overnight or will it be a slow and steady thing?
If TSLA busts through 665 we're mooning boi
That's why he did what he did
Congrats! I was there once. Then it drove straight down.
I am really starting to hate CRM
I just buy calls on red days (have a lot of shares ~30 something basis) and it‚Äôs worked like 80% of the time
I may have bought one of those
I love how much REEEEEEEEEEE ya'll have on .10% candles Christmas Eve.
Wasnt always like that. I bought one in 2013 and the forums used to be civil.
Please pray for my baba 12/31 calls
Do a 2k ish value spread that will never fucking hit. On AMZN or something
I love shopping calls
CRSR needs to go back to $50 again
should i let my apple covered calls be executed? this thing should dip back under $130 right?
Autocorrection got me
It's near its covid low now you don't think they haven't  already scared the vejesus out of investment?
Sold 20% of my position when it hit 20, letting the rest ride to the moon
GME and PLTR you were my most favoured retarded children, but a few weeks back I found a new child wandering the streets and decided to adopt it for a bit, it's name is BLNK - it is so retarded, it really does not know which direction it is going, it tries new things every day, I think I love it.
Investors finally tried Salesforce and realized its an ass system
Green dildo
Please Close The Market
Me niqqa
MT 12/31 25c gonna expire worthless.
with this news i wouldnt reccomend it. this will ripple for at least a few weeks. so that call will probably expire worthless.
That‚Äôs what it do.
BABA if you ever want to do the "be greedy when others are fearful and cower". Today is a day. This is Spartaaaaaa.
Buy super OTM SPY 0DTE contracts to the tune of 2k. Not difficult.

Kinda want to grab some yolo calls on BABA even though I hate everything Chinese
Jan 9th.
Drill team six incoming in the south southeast sector on GME, over.  Roger that.
it wont go fly again without correction
I'm still bullish but god damn its frustrating waiting on it. Thinking of opening some ITM debit spreads just to make sure I still get paid if it stays level
I mean the bigger picture of investment into the entire country of china.
Thanks BABA. Now I know what it feels like to live in a communist Country
Pleas fly again guy definitely just lost 50k on pinterest today
Worth it perhaps. Will be interesting to see how it trades when everyone returns for new years.  Feb calls might be better though. Or at least buy debit spreads like 240/250C
BABA is actually making a fool outta me. This stock is fundamentally not worth 218 USD dollars
fair enough, I don't have those diamond hands.
TSLA making the index boomers rich
Good news, only down 34k on my naked BABA puts before i sold
I grabbed em
For those who keep buying baba and it keeps dipping... you get what you fucking deserve! - joker voice
Honestly, good luck, I hope they end up ITM. I'd gladly take a 12.5% return on my purchase in 7 days.
I get the feeling  g m e  is about to üöÄüöÄüöÄ into the close.
Are my VALE 1/15 19c fucked or is the market just red this week. I wanna double down on this dip
I was told GME would be at 30 EOY
Barring a huge collapse I‚Äôll hold. I got in on my 665c for .92 so no reason not to hold. For you depends on how much you paid per contract and how muxh risk you want to take.
Nvda, CRM, Amazon boring as fuck
Going sideways after dropping that much is the first step of a bottom. So you can technically just buy around here with a stop loss under the little channel that it created.   Personally, I have my first buy order around 210 but I'm playing catch the falling knife.
Mine are dead. No point in selling, hoping I can get some back Monday, but 12/31 is dead. Bought a Jun and a LEAP while holding back tears :,(
LMAO I sold my BLNK calls at breakeven bc it was trading sideways for a bit there, and then boom it starts the next leg up to 53
Can someone give me an ELI5 why two of these options are down ~10% while the others are only down ~5% or less? https://imgur.com/a/atmfhEY  The Greeks don‚Äôt really support this outcome either for the calls that I‚Äôm holding.
They‚Äôre getting ready to dump it, I‚Äôm thinking...
Yeah. Honestly I sold. Might as well offset some gains at this point in the year...
Just ring the fucking bell

You sure could do that. If you want to basically ‚Äúput it on black‚Äù you could buy a handful of SPY 12/31 368c. If you want to be a maniac you‚Äôd put it on TSLA 660c 12/31

I almost did that exact thing yesterday, but ended up holding thru
Don‚Äôt worry GME call holders, the more shit I talk about it, the more it will go up. Anyways... GME DUMP EOD GONNA BE EPIC LOL
Its never good news when a communist country investigates you for being a monopoly. I mean, communism is basically a monopoly for government.

dont miss this FCEL run about to go down!

XL prepping to climb again! Buy the dip while you can!
Baba will drop to 215. Easiest puts ive ever bought
This is gay
good point. i stand corrected. fuck Bitch McTurtle
&gt; worse than expected earnings   No. Earnings were better than expected.    &gt; increased store closures   Which is a basic part of the turnaround playbook. You close underperforming stores so you can focus more resources on the ones that are profitable.    &gt; Filed for a 100M shelf offering which they will surely be using soon   Why will they surely be using it soon? On the tail of share buybacks when the company has plenty of money? They won‚Äôt. It‚Äôs a poison pill to defend against RC taking over. A weak one.      I get it. You don‚Äôt actually want to know why it‚Äôs a good buy. Go back to losing money on Tesla.
If china really does pursue antitrust against them, this could just be the beginning. I personally would wait a little while. Dont see it rebounding magically any time soon
They said that when it hit 270 too
It will Melvin fucking around and being a bitch

Lol @ dude calling STIC a pump and dump   am thinking he couldn‚Äôt get in under $16 and is now too cheap to get in over $18 üòÇüòÇ
No stock is fundamental we are in lala land
The crash of Christmas Eve 2020 for my portfolio
Bottom on GME
Spy and most indexes are best played with 2+ month expiration and atm. Weeklies are no good
Wait till the bottom shows itself. Never a good idea to buy on a decline. It‚Äôs heading to 260
Not a good day for LAZR, VLDR or MVIS
Def. no brainer. Bought myself a bunch of July 275 calls
Gen Tso's is tendies
I took profit. It's a short day today and dont wanan be staring at my phone lol
FCEL FCEL FCEL
*WW3 gets announced*
My first day today small loss. I had to see how this thing moves.
I used to hold GME shares. I still do, but I used to too.
Lidar more like gaydar
Die FUBO hahaah best short of my life ü§ëü§ëü§ë Imagine saying ¬´¬†100 by EOY¬†¬ª after a 200% runup
Yes xl's newest bag holder
Retarded. I'd buy muchhhhh further out if you are thinking about calls.
imagine falling for a coordinated WSB pump n dump
Imagine thinking you were smart for buying the BABA dip
Will my $BABA order go through for $205?
ICLN only goes up if you need a safe haven
PLTR will be stuck at $29 forever
For Christmas the market gave me an ass whooping
well ya...but im saying that the whole market is gonna suck on his dick... which is happening
free money tip buy 1/8/21 dash debit spreads
Common Christmas miracle!  TSLA 700!
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Is baba 1/15 240c good or do I need it to be dated farther out
Probably the spread and not a lot of volume. Look at the ask and bids.
Zoo wee momma it‚Äôs been a whole two hours
They‚Äôve always been nice to me when I post questions and stuff. I feel like the model 3 was the turning point in the sub. everyone fighting over there is a 3 owner.
Up by eod
better just forget spy, go w aapl tsla
You trying to get BABA holders to be even more depressed? Not cool man.
Soon $TSLA will be worth more than $BABA üòÑ ü§£
Everyone who said 220 was the BABA bottom .. fuck you
And then you have -6% days like me today and wipe out months of your 0.18% days.
Chill out people, lots of stocks are currently selling off.  People are taking EoY profits, trimming positions,  tax write-offs, etc.  It's after days like these that stocks will have random +5% days as people jump back in at a discount
Sad this all ends in 2 hours
I literally fuckinf hate sitting in Amazon calls while they die alll fucking day
I haven‚Äôt made any calls or puts on tesla but why on earth is It up
Can I stop Robinhood from auto selling?
where do you think TSLA is gonna end today?
Once all the soccer moms started getting Teslas, it was just downhill from there.
Ez tendies
I don‚Äôt think there is ever a wrong time to buy PTON
I think it‚Äôll struggle with 30 for a week or two before breaking out. I‚Äôve been writing covered calls and am looking to stop when it starts testing 30.
YEARS?! RIP Callholders
Out with a 500% gain on my 0DTE 645c‚Äôs. Merry Christmas Elon!
Spacs are the closest thing to free money there is in life
I just sold, gl bros
Dump PLTR
People been saying it's at the top since $7
Might‚Äôve followed pleas fly again guy into PINS. ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è    12/31 72C
Grab them if you are retarded, this is classic power struggle and will fall even lower when they announce the falsified charges when backroom talks breakdown again. BAT has nothing to fear because they already offload all their assets to oversea shell capitals, CCP has nothing to lose neither since they will keep fucking them until they take back control.  Buy the dip yes, but this is not it yet.
MM‚Äôs been raking it in for months with theta
Get on SPWR while you still can üöÄ
People were calling me dumb by selling at $55 this sub is retarted
AAPL is up about $1.50 since open...BRK.B is up about $1.50 since open...
AAPL and TSM saving my portfolio today. Who woulda thunk it

C3.ai (AI) about to complete its kast baby step for rocket launch, nothin but the moon from here boys
Same.
Wheres the Tim üçè fanboy??  He usually says sthg like  ‚ÄòTIM TIM TIM TIM TIM üó£ TIM üçè‚Äô
A rocket didn‚Äôt launch and someone asked for the company to fly again. Virgin galactic I think
Absolutely violated by Christopher Robin‚Äôs gang of woodland characters.. fuck you BABA, I loved you!
Come on pltr
Yeah with a EPS of 9.31 and a PE of 23 for a tech stock, its super overvalued. Ill get in at ipo price
SENS üöÄ
FUBO has ben good to me (rode it up from $25 to $60)      Time to go back in again
Please ban this idiot
What‚Äôs a good ticker to look into? PLTR is shit QS about to pop and THCB has no calls. Any suggestions guys?
Is LULU a good buy right now ?
NET IS UNSTOPPABLE
I don't know what's holding it back. But once FCELL breaks free it's going RIP UP MaSSIVELY üöÄüöÄüöÄ
That's why iI'm not rolling my 12/31 calls just yet. Technicals are set up nice, the shorts don't have enough to keep a big rally down. I hope we finish above 21 even though shorts are trying desperately to keep it below 21
STIC üöÄüöÄüöÄü§°ü§°
go back to /r/stocks
Also wondering this
I got burned lmao
Have enough liquidity to exercise at close
I bet the Gynese top officials already got out beforehand
Have enough money to buy all the stock of the contracts your holding.
GOüçÜEV is going really fucking down
AAPL said they‚Äôre going to be the next TSLA this week and you sleepy fucks really sat there and thought Plant Shit-Tier and a Game Just-Stop are the winning moves.
SPY 370 eod. No doubt
RKT is a $10b company
[removed]
PTON is not a bike company. It is a rocket ship.  New ATH
Farther and I‚Äôd wait for it to dip more
Fuck yes SOLO keep ripping
To much  n o i s e  in here today
Wtf is PLTR
190 imo and it stays there for a year
2 hours left AAAAHHHHHH
Nononono. I'm not a doomsgayer.
It‚Äôs been red for five days
Red christmas üéÑ
Should I hold FUBO or become a üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåàüêª
Etrade is fucking impossible to get in touch with wtf
looks like ~20.60 is GME's new floor?
My calls sure hope so
God speed brother. Right there with you.
BABA puts are up 15000%
Check volume and the bid/ask spread
Thinking of loading the boat on BABA shares at this level. $220 is more than 30% off ATH.
And miss out the weekly monday skyrocket after Friday dump? No thanks
Not I. Just bought my first most expensive naked call 220c June 2022. Usually a spread guy, for days like these.
Always teasing us. Common already PLTR!
Go long.  30PT.  Merger just completed this week, normal for SPACS to drop after merger. If you have weeklies, roll out and üöÄüñêüèª
Just a big green dido for aapl
In all of them and might as well go back to sleep
TSLA nooooo. Pleas come back
1000
Santa rally? Where is it?
Anyone playing WKHS today? Got 12/31 25c I‚Äôm just unsure about
We all know this is really because jack ma kept doing those Michael Jackson performances
That‚Äôs right hahahahah
üòé
Probably profit taking. It might take a day or so to straighten out and refuel
I hope you die
Santa gang üéÑüéÖ
Conflicted to go with spy calls or puts. Calls because stimulus spending bill, but puts because Republicans are doing retard level shut. But calls because free money, but puts because Donnie may throw this shit in the shredder. Wtf......
Been holding NVDA for 3 months and it hasn‚Äôt fucking moved, could have put that money in PLTR :(
Come on ARKK
ü•∫

who gonna leave money on xmas table ?
real products = bearish
NGL - starting to lose faith
The most coy stock
Bruh. I have about 25k in between calls and warrants riding on the GOEV.  Don't know how much longer until I dump this pos and keep it moving.
dissapointing
tired of watching pltr like this, i‚Äôll be back in january. merry christmas ya filthy animalz
Fuck him in his ugly ass
I grabbed some $140c jan 2023 calls
Buy and hold long it will come back
Just because something is being pumped doesnt make it a pump and dump.
Why is ROKU toying with my emotions?!??
Yup. Right before it hits 125 EOD.
yoloed my remaining $186 on TSLA 690 calls. What are the chances it goes in the money?
Recommend your favorite autobiography? Finishing Elon's and need something next.  *Position: RIOT leaps and selling weekly CCs against it"
Good boy go get the STICk
You think this investigation lasts less than a month?
https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kccpoi/found_this_on_twitter_how_fucked_is_he/
fuck SRNE why..
There were plenty of comments about lockup ending this week. Lots of people didn't know what that meant I guess?
switch to ToS, best customer service I've experienced in any industry
Just saying CCP prolly didn‚Äôt think that BABA gonna plunge with the antitrust investigation news cuz they didn‚Äôt see big drops from US scompanies when they announced the same thing. This means BABA gonna be bought at the dip and recover back to 250
a tweet after the virgin galactic launch fail
$XMAS calls
Maybe in the long run
its Christmas
RKT makes money on mortgages. Mortgages are at all time highs.
Fuck I wish I could short STIC
Is there any us broker that will let me buy lvmh? Lines at sephora are huge. Busiest store at the malls right now.
[removed]
Another day, another Amazon flat day
[removed]
BABA is like one of those tv commercials for boomers where they keep on dropping the price every 30 seconds to get you to buy now
Out of daytrades for the week. Any suggestions for holdings for the long weekend?
STIC causing some serious FOMO
You get reimbursement but not payment, that assumes you gained. Which is obvious you are retarded
none
Juicy dip on JMIA, hmmmmmm
See you Monday bro
Where did you buy? We will see it come back next week.
I'd play Jan 22 expiry. You get the tail risk of ü•≠ fucking with transition too
Welp- I sold BLNK too early. Sold 400x shares at 2.91 and closes Jan $10C in November‚Ä¶ FML
So many fomo‚Äôd into GME are now mad it‚Äôs not popping. It DID pop. Now you have to be patient for the next one.
Fuck man I need a rally on nio jeezuss
Well yeah, you believed the iCar was a thing? I hope you‚Äôre not holding the Lidar companies that rode along.
Post the loss
Guy in the TSLA forum on why engineers should work today and tomorrow to get the holiday update rolled out:  ‚ÄúI'm sure it will be as much as a present to them to see their passionate work in the hands of users and see their happy faces on reddit.‚Äù  Lmfaoo
Really good dip in FEYE, cyber security stock will be like green energy stock next year
Merry Christmas TSLA short sellers! Here is a bigger asshole for more dicks!
And you know who will fly past them after merger??? GHüëÅV
Another week, another shredded blue-collar paycheck. I see what I‚Äôm doing, I understand what I‚Äôm doing is stupid, and still...
BABA HOLDERS HAVE GONE EXTINCT
Bahahaha stupid bag holder
IPOF $15C for March exp
Santa rally feels more like a Santa crash
Never try and catch a falling knife.
wtf power hour starts in an hour??
That won't go over well with the shareholders who bought at 40b mkt cap
actually pretty possible
Its cause ur dumb
Wow, I am getting raped on NVIS
[removed]
PLTR trending like a scam stock about to get delisted by New Years. Dump that SHITSTAIN of a stock and put your money into VALUE stocks bros. Heed my warning....
Back in the USSR‚õè
Jeeeeezus,,,, at this price I'm actually considering grabbing more BABA
Obama
Wrong
Puts never ever ever work
BABA 220 and 225 strike price today are swining 50% every 2 mins.
What‚Äôs a good call to buy? I have $435 left to use today
I hope. I‚Äôm new to options and my luck has been shit this far
Buy NIO they said
Wake up, Cathie
I know that‚Äôs what I have now and am comparing it with. They are really amazing.  Not trying to switch over, was just curious about different platforms so went and opened a few little play accounts
Ofc TSM up after I stopped playing last week
$MS bounced off vwap if anyone cares.
people are dumbfuck assholes (see also: dolan trump elected president).  more people are buying Teslas  more people = more assholes. QED.
BLNK
Nice NIO dip there
Now I'm glad I found other bag holders.   Thought I was the only dumbass drowning out here.
It‚Äôs going to launch.
I just wanted a quick pump to $25 :(
Give me a good call to buy I have $435 left
[removed]
This isn‚Äôt very Merry
I‚Äôve been trying to contact them for weeks
Let Tesla fly!!!
Imagine selling TSLA before $700 üòÜ
I don't know if they care about that. It's more about keeping anyone from having too much power over there.
Red days are illegal for PLUG
Palantir dipped, buy now, and sell 29 cents higher for big money ü§ë
Imagine buying FSLY calls on the dip expecting a nice bounce
I don‚Äôt understand... but that‚Äôs ok more tendies for us ü§ëü§ëü§ë
Who did this? lol
RIP Canoo
This is the answer. But yeah I‚Äôm stunned that people aren‚Äôt hopping all over it.. this is easy double bagger by Jan.
Guys, genuine question. I got some tesla debit spreads 640/645 exp jan. 29. I bought them when tesla was $622, on december 22. Now this spreads change from positive to negative 50 percent every second. Should I just leave them to expire or try to sell it? And shouldn't it be always green anyway? Thanks!
I think I need that stimulus check more than ever now
I just need BABA at 225...
After dropping down to $17/share today I think we‚Äôre fucked. At this point I‚Äôm just hoping it goes back up a little so my losses aren‚Äôt as bad.
Just be Chinese LMAO, but if are really interested  https://asia.nikkei.com/Editor-s-Picks/China-up-close/Analysis-Xi-sees-Alibaba-and-Tencent-as-rising-threats-to-power  https://asia.nikkei.com/Editor-s-Picks/China-up-close/Analysis-Xi-s-message-to-Jack-Ma-You-re-nothing-but-a-cloud  https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-president-xi-jinping-halted-jack-ma-ant-ipo-11605203556  Ma got the taste of ultimate power, going back to being a nobody is a no even with money.

PLTR. Give me my money back. PLTR, do you hear me? I want my money back. Give me my fucking money back, you motherfucker.

He is being satcastic
Not trading today I don‚Äôt wanna get crushed before 1pm and lose money before christmas

üôãüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
FCEL.. can‚Äôt stress it enough
FEYE with the Megagay smh.
you have less patience than my 6 year old. it's been consolidating and trending upwards for like 3 weeks, chill haha
And if you order in the next minute, they‚Äôll throw in a free $BIDU with your purchase.
Seems like the damn alibaba thing is spilling into other Chinese stocks.
Since when does China give a shit about monopolies? These retards fell out of line and have to be put in their place, that is all..
Except RIOT is only monthly options
GME not moving üò¢
This is not how this was supposed to go
BABA up 2% on the year üòÇ
baba is going to crater from 1200-1300 today
STIC
We got a portfolio to burn
buy BABA 210$ puts? or sell what‚Äôs the difference
CCP gonna buy back shares slowly over time. They do care cuz it is a money maker. Just saying.
Can someone tell me the meat on FCEL looks like it‚Äôs in a fat dip should I hop in?
You know they aren‚Äôt actually selling anything until 2022 right?  That said, I was in early and will be holding long term I love their products and business model and so does their partner Hyundai.
It‚Äôs a longer term hold but we‚Äôre setting up for a nice lift off if we can break 30-31
Daddy needs stimmy to make some degenerate calls
No. Next real bottom is $16-$17. Then we'll ride to $25. Rinse and repeat, new higher lows until March. Buy the dips, sell the rips
Down a cool 6k today. Merry Christmas to me
red day
Only if you owned TSLA.
That‚Äôs why I ain‚Äôt trading today lol
Just checked Iborrowdesk. Shorts are trying to short it hard
How much more can BLNK really rip?
gj you bought high
You into music? A lot of good ones from rock and roll artists from the 60s and 70s. Loved Claptons and Gregg Allman's  but there are plenty of other good ones as well
Their earnings were literally worse than expected lol.  The primary problem is that they offered literally nothing as to why the hell anybody would go there over: Amazon, Target, Walmart.   I'm actually making a fair chunk of change on TSLA IV crush right now though so that's working out. Banks printed this week as well.
Arnold Schwarzenegger‚Äôs is pretty good.
are we still buying MVIS.  would like to add this to my list of meme stocks
Sold my 0DTE TSLA calls... didn‚Äôt to but that dip just now wiped out half my profits ($10,000) instantly üò≠
They don't until they do. I made 8.5k on June 10-11 when the spy dropped 6% I made 2.5k a month ago when spy gapped up over no news. Or the usual news of stimmy going well
How the fuck is SOLO green and GOEV -1.58?
That happened to me after September. Had so many small but good green days then boom -10% in 3 days
Look how they massacred my boy baba
This is the best GME dip were getting.  Don't fuck it up because it's a short day.
Fucking XL what the fuck
What is McConnells vendetta with weed? Personal issues, or some other influence?
Nice!! Learning every day dude will help you so much in the long game for big tendies
I hope bears are eating cause there better be no complaints if we green next week
Selling volume is off the chart but price goes up. How is that possible?
BABA triple bottom
Cathy woods bought baba before this. She is retarded
Plug is going to go off.
Glad I dumped that shit stain of a stock that is PLTR
Panic buy
Pleas dump so we can fly again
I do think there is a play here. They can't just liquidate it overnight. Might be some bleeding until the new year and then a rebound play
Fuck bro. I‚Äôd say GME, that thang is moving. I‚Äôm not invested though.
I was doing good last week, took losses this one for being impacient trying to ‚Äúday trade‚Äù. Never again, only betting on ‚Äúsure‚Äù things from now on
BUY THIS NVTA DIP
Last 30mins of trading day fren.
join the not valued at 3200 with no split in sight gang.
Should I hold these XL bags till Monday?
Fuck this CRM lol, I will move to meme stocks again now
Do you think it will continue?  I planned to trim this week so I closed all short term positions but some of my leaps getting shanked hard
The market reminds me of that one time I was fucking this girl reverse cow girl and it felt like my dick broke. She said ‚Äúother guys like it when I do it this way.‚Äù Other guys like their dicks being broken?
Well when Santa is high on cocaine driving the train to 375 he kinda forget about Christmas and to bring the rally with em
Vldr ran up 50% mon/tues. anyone that bought after that had it coming.
Done with options, SPAC‚Äôs only
Whichever one of you said in premarket yesterday "buy the MVIS dip, you can send me a tip later". Heres a tip, you are a fucking retard.
GameStop needs to announce their EV
Come on Elon 700 eod pls ü•≤
Wow, what a week. This Santa rally has been great. üò©üí¶
Fuckin a man
Someone smart give me a end of year yolo.
PlTr ShoRtS TsLa
Oh man this comment is gold. You belong here
I‚Äôve constantly lost 1300 every day this week so far
I am so sick of Amazon‚Äôs bullshit
Yeah, not very cash money at all... üòí
BABA just wants to get back home to China so it's gotta keep drilling
Nah I‚Äôm totally fine throwing it out as a gamble. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here lol
lol at people getting suckered into that STIC pump
No.
Same legit fuck this stock
Amzn options are retarded why am I in there
I'm 2 months out on my ARKK calls, so I'm not worried. Just need 2 solid weeks from her and I'll eat plenty good.
Fuck me I bought $23 0DTE feye puts at .14 and solder .33 this morning... now they‚Äôre worth 100 a piece
Broooo
given the year thats shockingly good.
I'm not touching spacs over $11. There's still plenty out there 9-10.50 range awaiting their turn
All I want for Xmas is a five figure day. Come on ü•≠ sign the stimmy
Doesn't BLNK look really overbought right now?
PLTR so stupid volatile jfc
because he's a hedge fund intern being paid to foment negative sentiment so his bosses don't get fucked
I have been promised a squeeze.
ARKK drops, ARKK leaps go up.  MMs just don‚Äôt want me to get in. üò≠üò≠
Smol pp n r g.

If you still haven‚Äôt learned your lesson with these Chinese stocks you kind of deserve it
If SPY really dumps right after I sell my 368Ps for a huge loss I‚Äôm going to lose my mind
GME
It was supposed to be a white Christmas but now, just brown and sad.
You know it‚Äôs bad when ARK and is red
BLNK in dis bitch
Upvote if we should stand back &amp; stand by on buying the BABA dip
Debit spreads can be priced fuckily until you get closer to expiration.  It should be at max gain, and will be very green, but you won‚Äôt see all of that until you‚Äôre closer to expiration.
That fucker is dying in its $220 hill.  -20% by end of day.
I got Jan 15s close enough for the news cycle to start buzzing about it alreast
All these paper handed bitches gonna help us fly üöÄüõ∏
Are we expecting a sell off at close again ?
Why does XL keep dropping?
Yeah I thought that as I typed it lmao
[removed]
I bought just cuz of meme potential. Not expecting it to pop off tho
He prefers cocaine
How is shorting a stock not manipulation ? You ‚Äúborrow‚Äù a couple million shares and then dump them flooding the que and then driving the price down?   Am I missing something here?
Not yet, spent all morning panic buying
BABA 240C for March guaranteed $$$?
Baba taking a massive dump
You and me both. Bleeding here
SPWR FLYINGGGGGG
SPAC are free money rn like it or not
Buying the BABA dip  Hopefully China's actions aren't too harsh.
that's a weird expiry with lower volume calls atm. So every time orders flow your brokerage will get weird with what they show as your net liquidating value. Check the bid-ask on those strikes, it's probably wide as fuck
Anyone holding through the long holiday weekend?
No lol
Let's destroy investor confidence in our companies so we can fuck over one person in particular. That'll show him ü§°
Triple pay and I‚Äôm in!
360P SPY
Yes but still need to be careful about buy in price
Yo I have a 700c expiring today üòÇ

CRWD killing me
Short wankers
I thought XL was the chosen one.
I doubt bleeding. I think it will recover slowly. It‚Äôs around the support line too.. I mean if it breaks down it‚Äôs done tho..
Already in
u must not understand how she trades. she will be double down until this shit hits the bottom.
I'd like to know!
BABA $230c 12/31
Everybody FOMO into AMD so my calls and shares can print üòî
Sir, this is a casino.
PLTR drained my entire account üòî
It do be like that
Absolutely
Nooooooo
LAme
Yes but idk what day I 3rd week of Jan but don't quote me on that
Yoloing my Christmas bonus on gme 0days.  My kids already got gifts on top of already having everything they can ever want.  Can Santa deliver for me?  I'd like more than a new pair of pj's this year.
It had a short report on it, so it's getting murdered.   If this stock is like any other that's had a hit piece out on it, it's going to rebound shortly. I doubled my position for the rebound.
Yeah that position isn‚Äôt for me. If she doesn‚Äôt know how to do it right and leans forward too much it just hurts.
Cathie will load up on BABA today
oh you'll get it back, probably not what you put in though
I‚Äôm with you.
Suck my yule log Xi!  üò°
Amzn and aapl pod racing rn
why are people buying BLNK when SBE (chargepoint) will be so much better after the SPAC merger
you would short a meme stock?
GME seems risky getting in now, I‚Äôve been fucked by it before
Looks like MMs are finally cashing out to buy their hookers coke for Christmas
anyone else still looking at rolls royce?  i feel like this is bottom, but who knows.
Today but look at their charts over the last week!
Tesla puts, right now, are free money.  That's my Christmas gift to you all.  Merry Christmas üéÑüéÑüéÑ
BABA gonna slowly bleed to $200 hol li shyt

Options on SPACs is the best money
32$
Any plays for $300 I need a winnnn
But thanks homie. Merry Christmas! (If that‚Äôs your thing)
We‚Äôre all going to have to come to terms with the fact that BLNK will eventually get to 182.
Rips up close to 100%, fine.   -10% ???

I hate how Robinhood calculates option value in a way that says the contract I just paid $22 for is only $20 so I lost 10% instantly even though you can't actually get it for $20 and I actually already paid less than the last sale before me

it was just up 25% and now theres no news its cooling off
Pretty boring day tbh bout to log off and go do some last minute shopping. How tf is it already 11:00?
Dipping now, how low will it go?
Pltr guh
Sorry to hear that. I would say if you are willing to average down that can be a good idea. Otherwise just wait a few weeks to see how things go. After all, it's only a loss if you sell at a loss
I hope you get coal coated in dog shit
But it‚Äôs going up...
Markets just a punching bag today huh
This day turning big gay
Please Jack, do something. I‚Äôve been loyal to you since 30 mins ago. Don‚Äôt let me down.
SOLO on the next dip
Products and revenue are bearish
I think it's because the pump yesterday was from an updated price target and not anything tangible.
Expiration is weeks from now. Don't be weak.
From 490 to the 3.2k back to 500 it‚Äôs been a fun month.. at most I pulled out 650 gonna take this last 500 to Vegas ü§ôü§ôü§ô see you when the stimmy hits and PLTR is 35 mid jan

I got in yesterday before close and out this AM
Pleas fly again

Right. Support is at $210 and then at $200.
What‚Äôs the next play? Boxing Day sales? Amazon calls?
God damn it PLTR y u do dis
I just look at what PLTR does every day, shake my head and laugh like a lunatic.
There‚Äôs a retard filter at the entrance. Only lets retards in.

Thats what I assumed with having far ITM debit spreads but just wanted to make sure. Thanks!
Just fucking bleed and hit bottom already. BABA dragging my boy NIO down for no good reason at all.
I can't possible predict, but if you were confident enough to buy a leap, and you had a decent entry on it, then don't worry   Close your app, walk away, enjoy the Xmas week my dude, don't get caught up in the manic WSB energy, most of the people screaming here have OTM weeklies

Lmao i remember when people in here called 280 the bottom on BABA...what a journey
God that wood gives me wood sheesh üòì
Buy the palantir dip!
Bruh you don't buy puts when it's going down. That's FOMO, and that's bad trading.  Listen to me or don't, I don't care. It's just a gift.
So sorry bud. EV is a tough market. I mean, really tough. Everything is jumping in now as all tech is maxed out.   Were you looking short or long hold?
Doesn't matter, morons across the world will still continue to invest in China while they do whatever the fuck they want. Chinese leaders are complete P.O.S.', I'm surprised people haven't figured this out yet.
Someone please stop BABA
Not the end yet. Dump b4 Xmas coming. 210 may happen
QS just grow already
What happened?
I‚Äôd wish you good luck but I‚Äôm rooting for NKLA to hit $0 where it belongs, so bad luck
Happy Holidays everyone. Its been a hell of a year on this sub and wish nothing but the best for you all, in and out of your trades.

Cannabis being illegal was the easiest way to put black people in jail and McConnell comes a line of confederates.
Bid and ask  + place limit order for the bid price  + wait for the dip  + bid price will always be lower than the average price
Literally just fuck these random quick sell offs man so frustrating
I have mostly leaps but threw in a few of those same 12/31s, fingers crossed for a christmas miracle next week!
Just so you know, snowflakes will fall across your RH app on Xmas day.  Just like our memefolios
at least April - you want to capture the Q4 earnings date and shareholder meeting in your window

Holy shit, baba just keeps going lower

I did that but the dip wasn't coming so I went closer to the ask to actually get the trade to execute
How is buying a stock not manipulation? You "borrow" a couple million dollars and then flood the queue with market orders, driving the price up?
Hoping PLTR ends at $28, just to see if the CC I sold get exercised.
All of a sudden China cares about ethics. Communist fucks
This is stolen lol

Who the fuck is selling BABA?? Buncha retards, institutional investors see value at this price point. Paper handed fucks
Half of this sub is shilling a ticker  Half of this sub is buying that ticker  Half of this sub is the MM algos finding the dumbest plays they call sell  Half of this sub is people who started trading in April and think it's the easiest thing ever  Half of this sub can't do fractions or any sort of math without a $ in front  And 300% of the posts are about GME, PLTR, or both

Well only lost 75% on BABA better than 99% I guess. Done with Chinese stocks forever. Those commie fucks are only interested in keeping power at all costs.
It is actually wide as fuck, wow. 0.20-5$, changes every second
Facts. It‚Äôs actually easier to control a few large companies vs a bunch of smaller ones anyways.

bought the BABA dip and it kept DIPPING
What‚Äôs your plan with the last $25?
It's a low volume day? It's fine.
Well damn what just happened to MVIS, I just doubled up on the dip though.
Yea we don‚Äôt know
MM stole my Christmas.
AMD is always 3 days late to a pump
So I made good $$$ back in Feb and March - told my dad about it at the time and he was so proud. Since then I have lost all of it and went very negative overall. Of course my dad asks me about it today and I tell him. Never seen my dad so disappointed and sad üòû
Hurricanes affect the gulf not Austin.
OK, bought
ok got rid of qqqj dead weight and got some ghi.v feb calls
Yikesss that's gotta sting - I had BABA puts this morning that I sold for 2, those are now over 4.50 and I'm kicking myself for playing too safe
China can actually decide to just shut down a company though
lmao

The US government will not shut down a business, CCP will without hesitation
I feel like TSLA is gonna stay in the 671-662 range until power hour when all of us small autists have sold off our 0d FD‚Äôs on RH and then moon 670
The market has been fucked up all year
We smokin that $Baba pak who wants a hit?
Shares so I‚Äôm good but man I‚Äôm getting jealous seeing all the other price movement out there.
That call is down 5% since I said no so that should be evidence enough. Plus China has complete control on their businesses and they could severely hurt the company with this lawsuit. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs impossible to gain but not guaranteed
institutional investors don't gamble with their money. There's tons of other shit you can buy why risk it on a commie fucked piece of crap
I hope PLTR ends above 28.5
What expiration date?
3 day rule mayne let it dip 2 days and only consider buying 3rd + day
I sold my TSLA 660c yesterday at high thinking that Trump closed the market today :(
Holy baba
Just bought some CRM $227.50 calls expiring today on this big dip. Ready for it to bounce back up to the $229-230 range now.
Worst casino ever
TSLA carrying SPY. Damn get all these other volatile stocks outta my portfolio. SPY should drop AMZN and MSFT. Too volatile.
Got it. Thanks so much man! I was a bit worried lol
I cant believe im saying this but theres no way id buy baba at even these levels. China can do whatever it wants to fuck them over
Have faith that next weak will be crazy because today SUX
Positions?
Was debating 220C or 215P on BABA, guess which one I chose..damn it  &amp;#x200B;  215P
Lol just bought 2/19/21 105c for NET on the mini dip. Figured it‚Äôs longer so if it goes down at some point I have room to hold until it‚Äôs up again
BABA stop drilling plz üòûüî´

it‚Äôs cuz baba is a stable investment,  it‚Äôs not rocket fuel.
Yeah makes sense, but the June 18th call for $41 is $3.83. The June $43c is $6.73.   The ETF right now is trading at $40.96
BAIL OUT BAIL OUTS ITS A TRAP
Because in China an antitrust case could fucking mean anything, based solely on the whims of the CCP. In the U.S. the regulators have to prove a case, and having good lawyers can actually help.

Sooo is WSB dying after that rant yesterday by the mods? Or are we cool? I‚Äôm legit confused as fuck.
These Amzn and NIO calls are fucking burning what the fuck
We put BABA in a spliff
This is the worst weak of the year for me. Took me forever to save and build up to 5k only to lose it all on TSLA on Monday fuck me man. I got like nothing except for my phone and laptop and I room with some bums.
Green day and this place is in shambles
Cucked by Cathy
Yea. Lets see
perhaps, good luck
Well technically everybody. But institutional investors selling off BABA at a substantial loss because of paper hands.   Also didn't China just write up the laws last year?
Ask the shorters who shorted it at 16 and crying about it on /r/stocks
It was over when it lost that $220 hill.
Looking back, I probably have 2-3x more losses than wins but the wins are much much bigger than the double digit losses lmao. It's funny seeing so much red in the gain/losses tab but the winners are so big theyre irrelevant.
TDOC or Roku??
I‚Äôm in the optimistic phase about to head towards the hoping phase. Please Jack don‚Äôt make me get into the denial stage on Monday.
Closing at 12 or 1

BABA means dad and it is so disappointing and sad too. Good luck man, I'm sure you can make better investments in the future.
fucking averaged down so many times on SQ. Yes, because SQ should really buy Tidal. fucking idiot. On a short low volume day. Idiot.
The market is closed tomorrow
Yall jump on that SENS rocket. We going to the moon.
I finally figured out what it feels like in here. This is the virtual equivalent of standing at the craps table. I don‚Äôt know any of you personally, some of you make me laugh, some of you make me a little nervous, but at the end of the night we‚Äôre all standing here with the same goal ... beat the house and go home positive.

They're assholes to their wiggers too. We love wiggers in America, dime a dozen
I‚Äôm debating if the shit trader panic sells here or buys the dip.
A christmas gift from the MMs. A tech dip.
Man I‚Äôm still holding. My expiry is in February but fuck man...this stock sucks
Oof
I am also hurting but trying to buy the dip today to cost average
baba completely fuk
Why even have a half day when there's no volume and it's flat. Ring the bell
at least you've got pepe
ok im in the bargaining phase, if pltr manages to hold 28 today I'm ok with that
can anyone give me a tldr explain like im 5 reason why baba is getting hit with antitrust from china? i thought china has authoritarian leadership how are they getting antitrust-ed?
Yes
Just bought 700 GME and set limit sell at 200, to infinity and beyond amirite
BABA is officially down YTD
Thinking about it
GME frozen in time at 20.69. Bullish
Only if bankruptcy is your kink

how did I fkn lose 10 percent of my portfolio this week lel
I'm balls deep in DKNG, pls moon bby
STIC just drew a Batman symbol, quick.
How's that penny stock doing?
Yea they are overreacting.... BABA is still going to be Amazon of China
why would you expect a rebound on a company with a monopoly investigation pending on its ceo?
Appreciate it chief I‚Äôll look for something else. Thought I‚Äôd buy the dip
Sell Jan puts the premium is nice
NFLX has hentai porn?  Sauce
yeah I always recommend checking OI/volume before opening a spread, and I typically do it on the monthly expiries cause those almost always have higher OI (so Jan 15, Feb 19 etc etc). You'll get a better fill most of the time and will generally be easier to exit when you need to.

we're fine, as evidenced by this discussion
I don‚Äôt think PLTR is a scam, I think it‚Äôs a little overvalued but I know little about the company and have no positions so I can‚Äôt talk
was anyone here holding baba puts?
Institutional investors dumping, retard.  Keep bag holding
LOL
NIO crew, are you guys still bullish? I'm down pretty big on the Jan 2022 $47 calls I bought today and am wondering if I should hold. Will this BABA news continue to bring it down, or are you expecting a bounce back?
Is trevvy unloading nkla? Nikola is shitting bricks!
Tesla car/stock owner since 2013 here. Blink is shit compared to ChargePoint. They‚Äôre just riding the EV speculation wave. I‚Äôm not touching it. Look at SBE if you want to invest in EV charging infrastructure.

OK IRON FUCKEN HANDS ENGAGE
holy fuck nio
Don't sleep on large material suppliers, specially WY. I build houses and lumber yards are getting record orders. Contractors everywhere are already scheduling closing dates into JULY!!

What‚Äôs the deal with baba ? Did murica declared war on China ?

Fuck it bough fubo at 44.50. Seeing ü§ëü§ë. my GME is the greatest suprise from WSB lately tho
Never gamble 100% of your net worth on options.... had you bought shares you would still be in the game.
AMZN calls fucking me but atleast its not as bad as BABA lmao
LMND puts, lock up expiring Monday. Let‚Äôs goo
Why not wait for a reversal instead of catching that falling knife? You might miss out on some gains but this might be nowhere near the bottom

NIO calls making my pp soft
BABA went skydiving with a pack filled with knives and forks instead of a parachute
PLTR may be stabilizing around 28. Phew... only -$600
i hate FUTU what a fucking trash stock
I exited at $222. Overall an $1800 loss on BABA but I predict it will keep going down for many days, if not weeks. Chinese "regulators" have unlimited power.
I'm bearish on GME from this price point. This is a purely mechanical/technical move up and will almost certainly not hold.  I'm actually long on PLTR, couple of 25/30c spreads expiring in 3 months.
You just can‚Äôt match robinhood‚Äôs professionalism   [Check out the pre-written questions in relation to an assignment notification lmao. complete with the üòß emoji and everything](https://imgur.com/a/Duoq1Dr)

Cathie gonna buy the BABA dip
ü§åüèº
Take the profits and hop back in at 160
True, everyone has been spamming pltr and gme. Not like it's a terrible thing because that's literally wsb. Too safe and boomer to talk about on wsb unless it's going parabolic or plummeting I guess?
Wow BABA not even giving bounces to sell
Maybe Cathie thought today was the 25th ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I have never played BABA, but is it worth getting in now on risky manipulated Chinese stock?
there‚Äôs gonna be a lot of sad bois at the Christmas dinner table this year
anyone else killing it with snap puts today?
I guess I am retarded enough to be here
What happened to BABA?
One of the Bisexual mods yeeted himself from the position. He's was one of our bois holding the line against the pump-n-dump scam bots.
My attempt to buy at the bottom of FEYE was about an hour too early
Zoom out to the monthly chart kiddo, relax
I hope so. My retarded ass has found a home with you degenerates and I have a new calling.. trying to become autistic
Hell I dont. I bought calls like a dollar below the top. I was up a little bit. Oh it will be good. Lost like 2000$ averaging down 0DTE. Fucking stupid.  Even CNBC said "why would they want that." idiot.
CRSR keeps hurting me and I keep coming back. It's like an abusive relationship. I love you baby
Lmfao bruh I left that shit. It literally fucks you every single time
As someone who has been hurt a lot  by BABA, I would wait.
Good.  Fuck NKLA aim its ear hole.
Fuck VLDR
it is in china...i think it's confused where it's going
What‚Äôs a good baba call quick retards!
BABA IS BIG DUMPING WTFFFFF

Same I got ahold of some ARKK in my roth today.

People around here think AAPL is a boomer stock cuz it can't go up 30% in a day. Except AAPL options have been printing tendies left and right and are way safer if you get em a couple months or a year out. Fucking zoomers circlejerking each other about MMs and short squeezes...
Probably 150
CRSR is my abusive lover. Who‚Äôs yours?

BABA negative for the year. WTF
I'd like to place a new order. üòé
I‚Äôm banking on BABA back to $240 by EOY.
Yes, but its short volume is 30% and it keeps climbing up. Thinking we see a +20% day in the next few weeks. Everyone is jumping on the EV wave and BLNK seems solid. Short term hold or OTM calls a few weeks out should print
Smacking it often works better
This is a fake dump, VXX isn‚Äôt moving at all

Hmmm, on second analysis maybe buying that BABA dip wasn't such a great idea. Who do I talk to about getting a refund?
That‚Äôs after Christmas
dont spit in the wind
Way too fucking high lol. I bought during the runup the other day.   I'm thinking after Christmas it'll trend upwards once the short report fizzles out. Depending on the velocity I'll either dip out at break even or hold.

how the fuck are baba calls not down much from todays all time high? wtf?
Baba is the exact reason you don't buy chinese stocks. Get too big? Make too much? Piss off pooh bear? The company is now the states, or they will just shut it down. Bye bye baba.
****YOUVE GOTTA BE A DUMB MF to not get FCEL on sale right now****
Going to dump a grand worth of credit from selling calls into GME before end of day, like a true retard. You don't have to buy to close sold calls, it's just free money.
Nio calls down 25%  CRM calls down 33%   don‚Äôt even wanna acknowledge my BABA calls üò≠
220 exp 1/8/21
I said that last time it dumped from $300 to like $260  I got fucked today. I thought $260 was bottom  Fuck Chinese Stocks man
Baba Feb and March vibe af. Everytime you thought it couldn't possibly go any lower, it just does lol
Just found out there‚Äôs no Santa rally cause there‚Äôs no Santa üéÖ
Cathie dump baba now bitch
Since when MSFT is volatile? It's been trading sideways for months!!
Phew I thought my 28 short calls on PLTR we‚Äôre gonna fuck me but looks like I‚Äôm safe.
&gt; CRSR   Same. I'm not sure why there is so much selling. I guess it just doesn't have meme potential, but solid company in my opinion.
BABA 5 EOD
C3.ai pump abd dump incoming, 180 target
It‚Äôs the Amazon of China they said.
So definitely no stimmy deal now. We‚Äôre gonna be RED unless they fix that shit
üê¥BIO June ‚Äò21 $5 calls
Yup I tried to warn everyone 2 days ago about it. I sold naked calls on those absolutely insane premiums. 75c jan 15 were going for 6 a pop hahah. Sold 10 of those easy 6k gain
BABA to the core
get into NET
crsr go up please
Sold TSLA calls and yolod into Baba puts. Pray for me
Fuck you NIO
Buying this PLTR dip. This is some fucking bullshit.
Fuck NIO

So many dips to buy omg yummmyyy free money. I love how people are hive minded and sell just because other people are, I just buy when everyone else is being a bitch and make bank the following days
BABA....
Xi
Just got called into HR because I told a coworker "Merry Christmas" instead of "Happy Holidays." Apparently what I said was offensive, not inclusive enough of all beliefs, and disrespectful to assume the coworker celebrates Christmas.  &amp;#x200B;  Just kidding that didn't happen. Merry Christmas everyone!
Not now...wait until 12/31
bruh i bought the BABA dip at 290. fuck me
I don't think I have seen any large cap crash this hard ever.      The only one that came close was TSLA back in September with the 20% down day.
No
Careful going full tilt like I am the past 2 days after consistent successful daytrading the past month.  I know to set stop losses below support because of stop loss hunters but I was so sick of losing I played more defensively, SQ dropped to barely touch $225 and immediately shot up to almost $228.  Tried to make back my 2K loss and turned it into 4K loss today, I‚Äôll let my LEAPS rebound since they‚Äôre mostly ITM but damn loss alot of gains suddenly
Good shit! I bought some ARKG/F/K and MOON
Mr. BABA, I don‚Äôt feel so good üòûüî´
AAPL going strong
Got it. Thanks again for the tip mate. Appreciate it!!
I hope not, they should switch their BABA holdings to JD.
What a fuckin wash out, bois......
For the MMs to pump and dump for their xmas lambo
PLTR stocks
How do I do this? Do I need to own the shares
You must start every single story with  "SO THERE I WAS, REPEATING EXACTLY WHAT THE NEWS TOLD ME"   Cocaine Mitch is based as fuck and you don't know shit about fuck
ICLN just dove off a cliff ü§°
Note to self. NEVER trade thanksgiving and Xmas week again. These two weeks have single handedly wiped out my yrly gains
Is this the bottom for BABA or can it go down any further? Right time to get in for Calls? I know it's unpredictable, but what's your take on it?
I love how this POS CRM really has no bottom
Avoiding the ultra-leftist subreddits today.  I don't want to see those Maoist role players praise China for taking down their Amazon (in such a power hungry, no respect for private property method).
WMT is a tech company and a drug dealer. Bullish
Probably no buyers so the price hasn't actually updated at all. The people with those calls are going to be stuck with them until expiry unless BABA can somehow bounce back.
Oh yea that shits manipulated af u good
Oh no baba what is going on?
So today doesn't really count, right?
Unbelievable overreaction for BABA. Huge opportunity.
Absolutely.. you gotta be crazy not to
Merry Christmas

Good day for my two biggest positions to be in BABA and SNAP lol
And.... CRM keeps plummeting.
I really just need to go to Vegas and cleanse my soul with strippers and booze for a few days.  Sigh....
PLTR traded their rocket ship for a submarine.
Anyone touching BABA?
-10% today,,, nice.
Crsr pleas fly again
Imagine thinking you know better than Cathie üòÇ
Yeah it looks like in september it bounced back up to 380 and november had strong support. I'm personally not touching zm since it relies on covid but it seems to have good support. Reminds me how nvda had insanely strong support on 480 for the past few months, it was great for a put credit spread.
Wtf is wrong with CRM

THICCCC red candle on BABAü§°
closed (for a small loss) my 28.5 PLTR covered calls too early. Shoulda waited till the end of the day and let them expire worthless.  Ah well...
You think it‚Äôll keep going up 3% everyday forever?
I would pay so much money to have access to a full time live stream following Jack Ma for the next week or so. Even more money than I already lost on BABA
This ARKK dip looking tempting
Who had BABA calls that were expiring today?
WHY EVER FUCKING SELL ANYTHING IT NEVER FUCKING MATTERS NOTHING MATTERS STOCKS ONLY GO UP A 1% DECREASE IN THE S&amp;P IS LITERALLY WORSE THAN THE HOLOCAUST IT CANNOT BE ALLOWED TO HAPPEN EVER AGAIN
Why sell?
BABA is one of the best examples that nothing matters besides momentum/fear.
BABA going under like it's about to go for a massive surgery
Going long, CRM or DKNG???
No its not.
I sold my calls at open for a 50k loss, glad I did.
Why PLTR is going down?
Could we get an F for BABA gang (including me)
XI pulls a Putin and Ma has to seek asylum in London.
thank the lord
forget Christmas can we just skip to Monday?
Knew it was coming, but I got absolutely faded today.
Lmao Fck you CRM
It's 1 thing to play a pump and dump.  It's another to hold a pump and dump thinking it's a long term hold.  So many of them here.
Healthy correction after being up every damn day almost?    Thats my guess.   Up 30% , up 22%, up 17%, down 2%  I buy the dips....  55% return since i got in (just stonks)
BABA 15 JAN 21 130 PUT  I think it's going to overreact a bit more before bottoming and bouncing back up like a psychotic roo.
When the dip keeps dippin...
Getting hammered today.. baba leading the charge to the toilet lol
Baba dip is more about ccp than anything. Global politics
Imagine investing in Jack Ma to fight Xi Jinping.
Hmm maybe I should‚Äôve waited on these BABA calls... ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

first day trading options and im up 7 percent. is the first one seriously always this free?
F baba
Tried to warn you
You can‚Äôt even buy puts on nikola because while they‚Äôre up bigly the premiums are so low cause no one wants to exercise these turds
Got this weird feeling China and BABA are in cahoots. This "antitrust" move by the chinese govt is just window dressing. China wants to show the business globe they hold their domestic companies accountable, so "please come foreigners, your business is safe here, there is no preferential treatment for domestic Chinese companies."
Gets bought by JPM and they start selling ¬£1 cigarettes
not with a 10 foot stick til Monday
sir this is a wendy‚Äôs
Not so sure about that... chinas antitrust means a lot more than us antitrust....baba is barely red on the year
So fubo not gonna stop going down huh
well this is boring

Is NIO getting monopoly for investigation too?
Yes, it can go down. No, it probably won‚Äôt average 2% a day like the last month. But if you are disciplined Cathie going to make you some money
Jesus ducking Christ BABA wtf
Ok Palantir, it's not funny anymore.
I waste my day trades on the stupidest shit I swear. I might as well not have them.

I guess now is as good a time as any to jump into PLTR. Was waiting for a good dip before buying.
All my shit is like 5% down. Omfg
Don't worry too much, I would imagine they will stack up some of the gravy from biscuit by proxy. I dont see their their balance sheets but I wouldn't guess that lumber makes up more than 20% of their overall profits
Not even considering it until it goes under $200.
If you removed BABa then you would leave a crater sized hole in your best economic producer. If the CCP wants to shoot it self in the foot. Then I guess that is their choice. But BABA can move it's head quarters. They are not forced to operate in CCP.
Down $300 from palantir, baba, ARKK Leaps.   Up 700 from Tesla.
rip pltr, but hold strong boys, itll be back
GME pls.....don‚Äôt do this to me.
Don‚Äôt worry boys! Everything is red today... hold strong!!!
nigga we at all time highs basically
Jesus when are they gonna halt BABA holy sheet
Grabbed one ‚òùÔ∏è might average up if it keeps drilling
let's see what the geniuses over at stocktwits have to say about BABA
You can call me a king because I'm being royally fucked by NIO and PLTR right now ü§¥üëë
No sir right to 25 please so I can drop a mortgage on it
F
Yeah. I feel like a spread is the way to go. But I'm feeling like spy 1dte calls @ 2% out isn't unreasonable. Congress knows they are about to get butt fucked by the new year if they don't do shit over the weekend.
HYLN and RKT are the grinches of Christmas
NIO at it's last support area around 45.60 then no mans land. F
BABA back to the 2010 xmas
Fun fact: the big boys get paid by what they have under management. It‚Äôs the end of the month, quarter, &amp; year.  Follow the big guys money as they pump their #s up just before they charge their customers....and then sell the profits the next day.
PLTR is in Denver. Lots of sunny days.
which dip should i fucking buy, so many of them
There is but he got Covid and he's super old so...
Yep pltr sucks, sold my put to early
WOW, WTF BABA. I am just sitting here watching my years of BABA gains vanish. WTF. Luckin 2.0
How tf is spy green
Short trading day with a closed market tomorrow.   Probably see a lot of selling off as we get closer to the 1:00 close.  I'm only a few months into this but each holiday week has had a small selloff.
I told you not to sleep on BTWN and here we are, rotation from Baba to Tokopedia
give it a good spanking for being naughty and give it coal for christmas
Copped 200 shares of GME @ $21.24, Merry crimbo cunts
Protip: It's a shit-tier stock
Gonna get higher
Yeah my put spread is dead
Is BABA even a buy at 200?
is this bc the $2000 stimulus was blocked by the reptilian republicans?
#NIO IM BEGGING YOU PLEASE
Real talk.
[removed]
Buying more dip than a Kentucky derby festival
Dude I are obsessed. It‚Äôs pathetic.   Stocks go up, stocks go down. It‚Äôs not the first note the last time this will happen. I guess it‚Äôs all new to you?
FUBO and BABA tryna outdo each other today
BABA pleas fly again!!!
I was looking at BABA 220C or 215P  Both were around 1.50, wetn with 220C, its down 60% already, 215P, up 100%.  all in ten mins
Q4 results.
oh god no please no
You think it‚Äôll rise again?
hey if you're up on a day like today congrats! It seems like it.
I think your name suits you
https://i.imgur.com/NmZIAVM.jpg
Ouchie
Yeah ZM is spooky but 1/15 is a close enough expiration that I‚Äôm not super worried.
So after blowing up my account on weeklies, I‚Äôve decided to become a more conservative inventor and put all my paychecks into long term PLTR calls. Can‚Äôt go tits up!
No mans land?
Like Buzz Lightyear, ARK is buy and hold for infinity and beyonddddddd
BABA 1Y graph looks absolutely disgusting
Thank you.
The CCP and PLA needs to be nuked.
Cool story bro
The $28 PLTR covered calls I sold on Monday is now OTM. Lol.  I wonder who held it for so long without exercising it. Fucking idiot.
why tf are people acting like PLTR is dead lmfao
Lol idiots ruining their own Christmas Eve with weeklies.
Webull has some really cool visualizations of potential profit etc.  Still not the easiest platform to use but they really have some potential
So you can buy one on BABA? Thanks for supporting the cause.
My wife's boyfriend is gonna be so pissed I second mortgaged our home on 12/24 $30Cs on GME yesterday :/
Made a small fortune buying NKLA puts when it spiked to 30 days before the lockup expired. Could there have been a more obvious play?
STOP THE COUNT
NKLA dead and buried
Down $300 from palantir, baba, ARKK Leaps.   Up 700 from Tesla.  Update: I‚Äôm down 400 now and up 600
Cost basis is 14.29. Balls fucking deep
This feels exactly like the half day before Thanksgiving
LMAO AND YOU GME CALL HOLDERS DIDNT THINK IT WOULD DUMP. LOOOOOOOOOOOL. TOLD YOU GUYS YESTERDAY. ITS GOING TO DUMP HARDER. GTFO!
I‚Äôm just not looking at RH today
moving my portfolio from $GME to $ROPE
Damn my ARKG calls are toast aren't they
A bit much on BABA lol
MM‚Äôs doing the most right now
Salivating at BABA. When it hits $200, buy $300 2022 LEAPs?
If only I learned my lesson...smh
RIP aliBlahBlah
Multimillionaire
It‚Äôs touching me, fffff. I just bought that dip today too.
My plan to buy the top was successful.
Glad I sold my BABA call for -50% yesterday instead of -99% today, cutting losers saved ya boy a rack
Coming here to comment my daily ‚ÄúFucking PLTR‚Äù
thats already half complete
I think TSLA will keep YO-Yoing between 620-660.  Hard to say if market is pricing in them meeting delivery targets or not. Thats gonna be the next catalyst for some kind of movement outside of that range I'd imagine
Weedmaps SSPK pump hop on the train chu chuu
Yes
They entered their trades at open. They had no idea what they were in for. Now they're staring at six MMs with guns drawn. It was a fucking ambush.   This was a fucking bomb dropping on WSB. For a few seconds, this place was Armageddon!  #There was a SELLOFF!
PLTR on sale ü•ÇüöÄüöÄüöÄ
SELL SELL SELL
right? Not gonna lie I feel RKT is going to hit like 19.89 and then skyrocket to $23-25 just gut feeling
I should know better to play crm
Nah fam they're just warming up the fuel cells
Remind Me! 5 days
Haha you are all so fucking stupid on here holy shit
[removed]
Oof that sucks, sorry man. All my calls are March ‚Äò21 or Jan ‚Äò22 so I‚Äôm not too worried, just hope Dorsey isn‚Äôt going full retard on me
those leaps are still fucked no?
Buy a boomer ETF. Don‚Äôt knock consistent gains. After a year you‚Äôll forget all about WSB.
Tech down left and right. Who let the Grich run the market today??
Why am I still buying RKT :(
Also depends on if you file jointly or single.  By ya that‚Äôs pretty much correct.  Unless you live in Puerto Rico for 6 months out of the year then you don‚Äôt pay any capital gains taxes after you move there on new positions.
Amazing how quickly my account turns red. What a showing by baba and PLTR
Yep, me too. Followed Cathie like a retard.
Baba calls are still dummy expensive
employee dump
Calls on literally anything are free money today. The next 3 months are about to be a beautiful bull run
I would think about buying the dip if my ass didnt look so red goddamn
They're selling off BABA like it's going bankrupt or somethin'
Fucking a PLTR. I keep averaging down on my 30c 1/15s but I'm almost out of money. Should I stop and just wait it out?
Well it‚Äôs been a great week overall if today‚Äôs gonna be a red day at least it‚Äôs over by 1pm
Oof
Tell me why I shouldn‚Äôt offer my first born on baba? They actually make money
Dear Diary, Today I lost 3k on BABA. My monthly portfolio gain wiped out
Touching your BABA sounds kinda dirty...
What y‚Äôall think of MDB?
Wow Merry Christmas
Is BABA still a value stock or a value trap?
Jesus god bless all the Baba put holders. Fuck
rip anyone with baba calls, now theyre red for the year
My 650 0dte still running.. Hope you are wrong!
baba die
fuckin pltr bitch fly the fuck again
Buy the fucking dip on PLTR
Close sesame...
They passed it, so I think he'll be all right. Unless he's waiting for a re-pass overriding the veto.
Xi canceled christmas, the way he intended

Must be investment firms selling off to close out the year

Tfw you wanted to buy STIC yesterday, but E-Trade refuses to make your funds available until the 30th for no fucking reason.     Feels bad.
i'm not exactly bullish on baba, but this thing has lost like \~30% of it's value in \~2 months.  it's not like their revenue is tanking, so exactly how much lower should it be expected to drop
Fucking Polar bears ate Santa.
[removed]
Palantards, how y'all holding up?
WHY
youll never ammount to anything, son
Nio peas pie in flame
LOL low volume moves and you think this is it? Remind me Monday
I think institutional brokers are running it down in toe with one another to squeeze as much profit into 2021 as they can.
BABA is negative for the year LMAO
Godfuckingdamnit
Great time to load up On ARKK leaps
If y‚Äôall ain‚Äôt buying up BABA calls/shares I donnnnnttttt knnnnooowwwwwwwww what else to tell you
RIOT and VLDR FUCKING ME
It just keeps dipping. I though 220 was the floor
If you are buying BABA shares just sell a put instead (if you can cover)  Premiums are high right now
Chill dude it‚Äôs gunna fly just wait for it
27 is the "fuck over all weeklies" number
G  E  V  0  having a big day  Let‚Äôs go boys

Holy shit baba is sitting on its 100MA with WEEKLY candles. This is either a great buy or the fucking end LOL.
That's why it dumped lol
No shit retard
Let‚Äôs all say it together: GUH
Fuck it bought 30 shares in BABA to hedge against my fucked calls ü§°
I'm 2022 4C. Cheap ass 13 month lotto tickets.
BABA red YTD hahahaha
If my Mom didn‚Äôt get me the Patagonia vest I wanted for Christmas I‚Äôm going to go ballistic. Everybody is a stock trader now these days. My robinhood app no longer tells people that I‚Äôm a Finance guy.   Luckily, the Patagonia vest hasn‚Äôt been adopted yet. But, if I don‚Äôt get this vest, how will Stacy know I‚Äôm in finance and not just some marketing nerd when we talk at the water cooler on Monday?   I used to just leave my phone sitting on the table with robinhood open but now even Rick in maintenance gives me stock tips. Buddy, do you see the vest? Okay, I‚Äôm in finance. I don‚Äôt need a guy wearing Carhartt telling me what to buy.   This has been the worst year ever.
I dump a lot into my indexes every year. Just figured I could maybe have a minor degree of success with this shit but clearly I was way, way wrong
Low volume. Gonna wait for the bleed all day and then enter before close
BFT getting its Dick a lil wet today
Holy fuck BABA

R.I.P. my 14,000 shares of PLTR
I think alot of people are loosing money today
Baba down 100$ since top
Almost bought BABA $300 January expiration üò§ glad I trusted my gut and not the sub

ok friend. DIamond hand  turn it off and come back monday. were still so far up this week were good.  Unless you are dumbass that has shit expiring today.
Jack Ma you Minecraft headed mofo, why couldn't you keep your fucking mouth shut back in November?      Fucker singlehandedly wiped of billions in market cap with 1 fuckin sentence
somebody need to pass the morphine drip to these baba bros out here
Guys it's right before Xmas. We knew everything would go down. If you sell PLTR now you are a moron and a coward. The UK just signed a deal with them yesterday.
So we‚Äôre gonna get cucked again with stimulus.   SPY 360 12/28
I actually cannot believe this BABA shit. There‚Äôs no chance they keep this up for long this is such an overreaction
Going for the Derry Mckesson look
I'm getting fucked good today
PLTR you stupid ugly whore. You‚Äôre gonna knock my 1/15 calls OTM soon. Cunt.
F it, I just got in on some LEAP's... Can't go tits up.

It's a few weeks. Do you have calls or what do you have?

GME available shares to short went to 4K from 150k at 945 am this morning before going back to 150k by 10am. The war is on
As a Chinese:  IMAGINE BASING YOUR ENTIRE PORTFOLIO ON BABA WHEN NEWS OF POWER STRUGGLE BROKE IN OCTOBER LMAOOOOO THERE'S A REASON CHINESE AVOIDED IT LIKE PLAGUE DESPITE THEIR PROFITS
Bad day. Wait for alibaba goes to 190
Why isn‚Äôt baba being halted?
PLTR been doing this for a month.  why is everyone surprised.
[removed]
If you have to ask you need to do some googling before fucking with options lol. But to answer your question, no you don‚Äôt need to own shares to sell puts. You either need level 3 options approval or you need cash to cover the cost of the shares if you were to be assigned

I can‚Äôt believe people sell Stocks like NIO and Xpeng when they are at the low point before a bull run. People are literally so stupid it hurts to imagine it
My tickers rn: You get to see a new daily low! and YOU get to see a new daily low!! and BABA let‚Äôs take you back to June lows!!!
Volume is very low, as you can see from the whole day it is making big swings, I wouldn‚Äôt look into today too Much
I just sold. 3k loss today baby
Me too buddy, me too.
Its a joke relax
Baba is dead
I thought y‚Äôall said it was illegal to be red on Xmas eve ? üòê
Described as a "corporate husk". Got them a Shitron style hit piece.
Usually for the holidays I‚Äôd think about spy calls but I feel like there‚Äôs more catalysts for it to drop this year
woa...lol  any show polish around? might be better?
I haven't been this poor since Tuesday. It's rough.
[removed]
NIO might dip down to 40 before reattempting \~49/50 again.  Look at the chart, it's trading in a range: \~38 lower, \~49/50 upper.  I put a 'feeler' call into play, waiting for it to tap the lower bound and head up a bit before adding to my position.  March calls.
Nio is a buy rn. Keep watch for a dip and enter. The only reason it's down is because of BABA and maybe because calls expire today. It'll push up to the NIO day on Jan 9th.

Hey did you know market closes at 1pm today?
I guess today's red was kind of expected after this green as fuck week
What's the play for NIO day
My dude it is down 1.5% today after being up 29% the past week.  We're fine unless you bought OTM calls expiring today.  But this has always been a play for like, March or April, so.
Baba basically same price as it was two and a half years ago.  That‚Äôs wild.   Could‚Äôve made a killing with so many other options

Well, there goes my first week trading options, feel like I picked a horrible week to start. God fucking damn is this shit a roller coaster ride. I honestly don‚Äôt know how some of you take 2-10k losses so well, regardless of your portfolio or financial situation. I guess I‚Äôll get used to it.  Only lost like 500 which I‚Äôm sick over but I feel the lessons I learned were almost worth it.  Let‚Äôs get filthy rich next year you dick headsü•Ç

Bull case for ICLN in 2021 is Dems will talk big game about clean energy initiatives and every time they do that ICLN will go up. Then the big pump comes from when they actually get a bill together on clean energy

Holy fuck PLZ STOP THE DRILLING BABA. Worst christmas ever.
I got burned bigly last rug pull and learned no matter how much potential this stock has, it is toxic waste until this anti trust stuff is resolved. That being said, if it goes to 200 it will be very temping.
Everything is down but SPY is up...ok

Buy the baba dip?
BABA should bounce back, this kind of shit even happens in the US where the government all of a sudden decided to ‚Äúbreak up‚Äù a major company. You‚Äôll see the share price fall drastically but it‚Äôll rebound within a year.  Just a ploy at insider trading. Chinese politicians probably shorted BABA last week. US did the same thing recently with Apple and Google.

Hope that BABA quits fucking it up for everyone is the only play for NIO right now. People are too retarded to do any DD and realize NIO is actually backed by Chinese government and plays ball with them. Instead they see BABAs issues and "hurr durr all China stocks bad"
[removed]
BABA BIG FUCKED
Why
WTF BABA
So i‚Äôm the only one out here positioning for a gov lockdown on Monday?!?!?
492%
My entire portfolio is getting slained but DASH stays afloat !! ü§°ü§°
My read on it would be that China can and will randomly nuke any company within its borders (because Jack Ma said some bad stuff). That doesn't seem like a good signal for foreign investment.

Damn even the Chinese dont fuck with Chinese companies...smart.
Good thing my $90K in 20C,25C,30C  calls expires May
Shoulda bought oil calls, long global warming and fuck polar bears
can arkg continue to go down so i can buy please thank you
Wait. Not even a dip to buy into rn.
Don‚Äôt FOMO if you really have to make sure the stock has not passed 2 percent. Buy the dip, and never play earnings.
Holy fuck i got slaughtered today, just woke up  MT, C, MS, PLTR, RIOT sell off and all my calls are fucked  SWEET
bruh imagine buying it at $290
TDOC
I been saying today will be a sell off going into a 3 day weekend. I fucking told you all
Wait till the day ends
Imagine thinking this week was green af lol ü§°ü§°ü§°
If you sold today go chew on concrete
Not a bad idea, however I bet the Chinese anti monopoly police have a little more leverage there than here.  If they do fail it will be a super bull
out of FEYE at $23.. could be worse
nice
Fuck a Melvin all my homies long memestop
Probably because y‚Äôall are the only ones buying baba ü•¥
Did I just hear the faint white of a printer?
Wait what
I bought tons of SSPK warrants at the top. AMA
Down 8% in HK and went sent them down another 8 in less than 2 hours on 85million in volume loooool
How the hell is my entire portfolio red and every index is green?
I'd hold off until after New Years
If the market could just close that'd be great
I‚Äôd cum
SQ
AMD HATES MONEY I GUESS
With the way its dropping youd think CRM was the one who blocked the stimmy
godspeed to you
This is why I love options   You could have bought 20 BABA 12/31 230p for $30 each = $600 total   Now there worth $19.00 a piece = $38,000
Yeah that's pretty bad. Sorry about your day.
FCELL about to burst. Paper hands have been shaken off and volume is increasing! üìà
True but this has been an ongoing saga for me
If you believe you have the worst luck and happen to be bagholding BABA, take one for the team and sell so BABA can moon.
Part of me genuinely believes BABA might not be an overreaction. CCP could annihilate that company.
HAHAGAHA TIGGERED BABA HOLDER IM DUMPING MORE NOW !!
[removed]
....did I blow my load too soon then?
my degenerate 0DTE contracts agree with you
We will win
except you never know what the CCP is capable of. I myself think this is over cooked, but you just don't know.   plus, BABA is already pretty weird from corporate structure standpoint, ADR investors don't have a lot of protection.   However, yes, usually a good thing to buy during blood in the streets
Good Point.  What is the next entry....$190?
If you don't buy this dip, you ain't chinese
Are $ROPE stores open on Christmas Eve?
I'm not selling!!!!    Holding psth, mt and stic    Just think of this as paying less in taxes this year
I kind of wanna buy this BABA dip but I don‚Äôt trust chinese companies and unduly influence the gov can exert on them
ARKG rug pull üò°
Why is Corsair tanking again lol
FSLY sold off more than BABA did for less
That's fair. Best of luck to you
Sold my other half at the top. Ill take it.
Lmfao everything down besides TSLA Falcon launching past the moon rn
Brexit probably
Less than 2 hours
Exit 50x 110 1/15 TSM for a loss?  My premium is 2.65 and its at 2.31 rn
I'm trying to close out some covered calls I sold on the pump. 50% gain in 30 minutes :)
XL showing signs of life  Edit: or not lmao 2% drop in half a second, just not gonna look at it until Monday
Why they are killing it today and have been all week?
Got 2k give me something good to hold over the weekend
That FUBo drop is crazy given all the recent price upgrades
TSLA market cap higher than BABA  LOLOLOL
ARKG WTF
Am I able to display my RH portfolio on a big screen outside my house and call it festive decoration?   This shit is flashing red and green
Man...you were right....
Bought the PLTR dip
Wait to see what the wedges do before throwing your hand down. They will tell you when it‚Äôs going to go up or down.
Brexit is over
WISH down 3.5% and my calls are only down 5% lol
Okay BABA you filled your gaps, turn the fuck around.
Very few things are free money lol.
Fuck yah. You know I am. Bout be 5K on at EOD.
On Christmas Eve, both bears and bulls have something to celebrate. BABA may be in freefall, but TSLA is pumping.
cause yours calls already down 92.9%
Will dividend auto reinvestments show up in my total return on the stock?
It wasn't Shitron, just that style. It was [Hindenberg Research](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/microvision-mvis-short-seller-hindenburg-research).
You got a good fill, option premium went up more than price drop
Hope you didn‚Äôt have calls. It‚Äôll go back up in a couple of months. I swear there‚Äôs no stock that is more affected by news on China more than this one. All the trump threats affected the stock immediately then it went back up. Been burned many times over. This time will be no different.
probably not since it has such a large revenue flow but who knows/
And just like that I‚Äôm in the red  Whatever, this week was nice and January is close enough, I‚Äôll survive.
Same ü§ëü§ëü§ëü§ë
u/RayTDalio sorry for your losses on your son and BABA  #F
Free dips on a bunch of stuff!
Good to be back on Elon's moon mission
Such easy money to play the swings. Might miss out when it finally breaks through but it is what it is
Just a reminder that it's only money. Unfortunately, money buys shit.
Lmao that does put a smile on my face!
GH..IV PRINTING DOE
Anyone gonna buy leaps on BABA?
yeah... imagine....
Fuck you spy im holding these 370 calls
There‚Äôs your resistance on BABA
I bought BABA today at bell -8%. I got jaded I didn't realize it's now -17%. Nothing is real
I bought the 370/380c call debit spreads for 1/15. If it closes above 380 on 1/15, I‚Äôm Gucci
It's truly amazing how dysfunctional the US govt is.  It looks like yet another shutdown is going to happen, even if it is short.  The US govt can't even fund itself to stay open, which happens almost every. single. year at this point.  COVID relief, which should be an obvious, can't even pass after months of bullshit.  Every single minute thing has to turn into an ideological WWF Summer Slam cage match brawl that goes on for forever.
who?
3 day rule
Looks like Baba's fnally turning around 210 seems to be the bottom
Its China...a thousand years is short term for them
I love how tsla is just dancing while the market is on its period
Jack Ma is going to lose - everyone just get the fuck out of Baba
PLTR to the moon we just hit intraday bottom
First one
Cao zhongguo
50 STIC shares returning more than 200 PSTH lol
My dad is about to beat the shit out of my brother lol. This mf is bitching my dad out for stealing his hot water. Bro, you‚Äôre 20 years old and live at home and pay no rent. Lmfao.
70 percent here
breaking news: BABA admits to causing covid.
- Check BABA - Try not to cry - Cry
Don‚Äôt do it I have the subscription
Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away..
Enjoying their gains and not working today I guess...
I wonder the same thing...such a POS stock
Yeah. HK -8%, US -16%  I'm thinking they know more about the CCP than we do here
LISTEN RETARDS XL REVERSAL IS NEXT WEEK HOP IN THIS DIP OR CRY LIKE GME HOLDERS
Someone reassure me that this is an overreaction on BABA
ü§°s in here told people to buy the BABA "dip" at 280 lmao tHE ChiNeSE AmaZOn
"but this week was so green" lol. Like a handful of tickers were green this week but idiots acting like this was a green week around here.
Oh my god, loss porn would be red. Gain porn would be green. THOSE R CHRISTMAS COLORS
no, don't do that at this current IV.  Sell put credit spreads, or buy call debit spread.
Do I swap BABA for PLTR?
Let‚Äôs see if spy can hold. I have spy puts rn to balance out some of my calls
Sweet CRSR sell off
My take from this is that stimulus checks = GME moon  Mooned when they confirmed 600$ and died when confirmed no checks until next week
at this point i‚Äôm fucking done with chinese stocks i‚Äôm going to hold on to what i have and hopefully break even within the next year
Down $7. Nnever going to finanancially recover from this.
So it's actually 5:30...  [http://letmegooglethat.com/?q=What+time+does+the+market+close+on+christmas+eve](http://letmegooglethat.com/?q=What+time+does+the+market+close+on+christmas+eve)
Yup and my calls thanks it, cashed out too bby
Just dumped by BABA leaps for a -99% loss ü§° rolled whatever's left into puts, leggo!
That‚Äôs when you sell the news.
BABA....scorched earth....
Dang, 1k in BABA 250P yesterday at close would‚Äôve been worth &gt;100k ü•¥
The fact PLTR is still going up week by week despite this daily immense downward pressure is amazing
Idk if to hold thru or sell the news
Quick EOD call to make lunch money what‚Äôs everyone got????
Diamond handers now trying to remember why it was a good idea
Theta gang has enter the chat.  I don't give a fuck which way it moves as long as it stays above $31
30k into ARKG 1/15
N p a going to follow s. R. A. C.   Also, jump your punk asses on the $wish train before it catches fire
Im not worried about the GME dip today, but its really not gonna be fun having to look at this big ugly red line on rh until monday lol
F
Up 50% still, bought them monday and had two +3% days after
anybody buying a 660 p on tsla?
Buy BABA leaps?
I just need it to drop 3 more dollars in before end of day.  Otherwise I'm poor
What is the deal with TSLA? Is this stock going to 1000 or what? I keep selling puts and betting against Elon and I keep losing! FML
Can‚Äôt believe jd is dropping too, I really thought I had a big brain play
Christmas Eve portfolio massacre in fucked
You mean support?
Power hour at 12-1 and pretty much everything is flat or dying
BABA 12/31 P's
Could go to 189
just be patient if you wanna ride the amd wave their ER will come and so will ur tendies.
Buy the FEYE dip???  1/2022 30c
Missed the bottom by a lot when buying up.  Ah well, nice to have positions sorted before I go away.
Bought GME this morning   This is nice
That's far enough out for them to do another flight attempt. I say hold it until the day before the next test flight.
I don't know how high it's gonna get, but I don't plan on selling for a bit
I don‚Äôt hold baba and never will.  I‚Äôm just tired of idiots like yourself spamming this thread with unfunny garbage, you are unoriginal, boring, idiotic. Let the others meme. You should be on the forums of yahoo finance, you fucktard
Alexa stop playing bulls on parade
BABA 100 EOY
now if PTON could tank, that'd be great üö¥üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüìâ
Dumped all LMND yest at $135 phew
Regardless SPY goes up
Are those FDs? Maybe. Theta decay still hits tomorrow but I wouldn't lock in a loss greater than 30%. We could rocket up at anytime.
Nothing like losing over 7k Christmas eve! How fun
I Bought BABA LEAPS !! Happy now? I said it! Lol
its prob just a temp pull back but i want to hear about the WSB bro that finally fomo into GME at 21+
XL is starting that late-day U-Turn. Get in while you can.
Why am I in NIO calls again?  Did I think it was seriously going back to $50 soon?
Tsla go ‚§¥Ô∏è call contracts value go ‚§µÔ∏è
Baba a buy at $200 weekly support?
If it doesn‚Äôt seem to be breaking out I‚Äôll probably sell next week or the week after while its still got some extrinsic value
Daddy pow
More like CCP wanted to buy another aircraft carrier so they shorted BABA
GME down .33 cents and it‚Äôs going to cause mass panic lol. Hold your shares retards. We aren‚Äôt going to moon everyday of the week. Resume moon mission next week. Stop buying weekly calls.
Imagine this happening to amazon
R we buying baba long?
[well that happened faster than I thought it would](https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kjdkdk/_/ggwjk64/?context=1)
FUBO ticker changing to FUBAR for this pre-holiday special
Dude only place to go from here on WISH is up. I jumped on the bot with you yesterday. Bought july calls because when this catches fire it will double
To all my fallen BABA soldiers:  GUH!  This war is not over.
Yeah, i feel the same way. I think this is the top. And to make it worse, I think we are at a point where as things get better, tech will sell off more offsetting the gains from travel, industrial stocks
Thankfully my 20k reup doesn't hit rh until Monday apparently
I don't think we will see any crazy moves till after the 25th. Everything seems on auto pilot ,cept BABA . Poor bastards.
I‚Äôm seeing that I was completely wrong. Brb investing in $ROPE
No, it doesn't.  In fact, I should have a flair that reads, "ain't learned shit".  I've stopped trying to learn shit, I'm actually making a bit of $ by following meme pumps and the occasional yolo.  The BABA play is a premium flip with no ITM expectation.  Total gamble, but I'm willing to risk a little $ on it.
The indexes are green, but I'm getting destroyed. Down 1.8%. I won't financially recover from this until Monday ü§£
It didn't pass before because of election garbage. Now Trump is slowing it down because Trump.
SANTA HELP US!!!!
Bigly red dips are your gifts to open up after Christmas.
AMD lets go
TSLA is a rock
Buy ARKG dip?

It‚Äôs actually hilarious baba dies because the ceo said 1 bad thing and the dictatorship does an antimonopoly law. Do they not see the irony!!! Ugh
BABA - Black Sheep üêë
Anybody else getting in lulu  Will have a blowout Xmas with all these home gyms

Bought a lot more PLTR shares on that dip
Ur an animal
My boy BABA getting slaughtered before christmas
Bought one for 09/2021 $250c
I'm mortgaging my house and buying leaps with it then
Ya, I am trying to find stocks that are up. Tesla is probably pulling SPY up, but not sure why Dow is up.
Will do thanks man
Oh geeze.
This dude on Bloomberg saying we don‚Äôt need 2k$ while on his HUGE house, fuck that guy
Who knows who. It's down 17% in a day on a government investigation. Beyond insane.
You need to zoom out on your charts my dude.
Burst down.
Index up but all stocks down. Cool
I ain't seeing any BABA loss porn yet üò§
His hot water he doesn‚Äôt pay for lol
M V I S üöÄ going to the moon
I just realized, the 12/24 call holders must be getting crushed due to IV drop from 1 pm close.  damn, sorry fellas
If gme tests the 20 dollar mark then we going to 25 by EOY
Too risky betting on individual EV/SPACs so why don‚Äôt I just put everything on ETFs that track ALL of their losses at once hahaha :(
Wanna know the power of diversification? Have 10 stocks and all 10 are deep red. Fuck diversification.
Str8 up bought leaps of BABA it keeps going down but my profit keep running up - so I‚Äôm glad I chose the right month
[removed]
Is this a buying opportunity for BABA or are we going to be seeing it dip even more...?
Say it sith me: **CHYNA IS FUK!!**
Id think MM are equally as retarded as us, so they also lose money
yeah been waiting for awhile for this to brew. thats ok ill leave a bit of ammo to avg down
Well today BABA play shut the bed but you‚Äôre right about the aapl one it did hit like 20% the day it was posted but I missed my chance to sell  The RIOT one was an instant fail too  Have to be wise licking the plays but it can be a mind fuck with the volume on some of them
My faith in CRM has been destroyed. These calls are fucked.
?????? the underlying is down 16%...
After experiencing March, one decently red day on portfolio doesn‚Äôt even phase me anymore üò§
RIP
BABA$   INVESTORS   WHAT HAVE U LEARNED !!!    Please tell me u won‚Äôt do the same stupid shit on Monday like learn from your fucken mistakes

Yeaaaah let me buy this gme at 20
Anything worth jumping into today? Need some cash
I don't know why calls are so cheap especially with how volatile it is, good luck to us fam
SPY fall to 367 before noon please ty
That‚Äôs what I meant. Thank you! Trying to put together Christmas toys for the young one.
BABA retards post loss porn, the most important thing you cucks can do today instead of staring at the rope hanging off your kitchen fan
its fine only a few leaps. worst case i baghold/sell weeklies against it.
My buy order is at exactly 210 so hopefully it hits and moons.
I‚Äôll show you something that‚Äôs about to burst
&gt; rebound within a year.  Sure, in time.  But right now that knife is falling and you're more likely to catch the blade than the handle.  I'm going to steal another Redditor's comment and say that how China handles this says a lot about how foreign investment should look at China. If they nationalize BABA get everything out of China. If they fine Ma with a slap on the wrist then and move on then buy Chinese stocks. Both of these represent extreme ends of the spectrum, what actually happens will fall in between.
Everything is losing. Just hold strong. This is a dip if I‚Äôve ever seen one.
Man your asshole is leaking cum from the Pounding bears are giving u
Lmao it‚Äôs over over
Fantastic, if you flip your screen upside down
I like this. This makes me feel better. This is what I‚Äôll believe.
Lolllll. Stop. üëú
Been hearing that for a month.
guys, CRM is maxed out for growth. they don't have an easy path to enormous revenue growth anymore.   beware
We were promised a santa rally
Consolidation is for the bulls

My screen is a fucking bloodbath right now. So red.
I told people not to buy the dip. You don‚Äôt fuck with the CCP
[removed]
FCEL bros it's time to buy the dip ü§ë
AMZN at its pinch point
CCP just wants to flex their power, they know better than to completely upend a major domestic retailer like that.  But yeah, Chinese stocks are always inherently a gamble for the reasons you mentioned.
You see the interview with Elon Musk and Jack Ma?  TSLA should be multiples higher than BABA.  Only a fool would not sell BABA stock after watching that interview.  Jack MA is a moron.
Nobody wants to sell
It is clear that the greatest risk to GME Moon Mission is the weak hands who panic over a 1.3% down day after +25% ... Folks just need to buy and hold shares and we will make Melvin and the boomer fucks burn
Raise your hand if NIO is hurting you rn
Anyone lose big on BABA?
STOP THE COUNT
Alibaba intrlligence!
For someone who‚Äôs never messed with BABA before, would anyone consider this a good entry point?
my Tesla call expires today even though it's up $50 since I bought it, because the premium was so high I'm only going to make like $80 stupid premiums

was just thinking about buying puts on BABA..just wanted to wait an hour now its gone!
Right there with you my fellow *investor*.
It‚Äôs so disappointing. I‚Äôve lost 6k this year. I have to figure out a way to inverse my myself. So tired of this stair step to the bottom...
You have a kitchen fan?
Is BABA dragging down Gyna stonks in general, TSLA up but NIO and XPEV are down
CRSR fire sale

It's retesting 27.9 as resistance and heading lower...

When shit was tanking in March. How many of you bought the dip and how many of you quit the market for a bit?
When the Grinch stole Gainsmas
I would
BABA on life support at $211
down 11k today
JEROME! JEROME! Wake up!!!
I'd set it at 212, don't wanna miss the big upside for  1%
I was having fun but now I'm not.
Jesus Christ, stopping kicking me while I‚Äôm already down, XPEV and NIO.
Just wrecked over here.
Oh shit but don‚Äôt get me started on the MRNA 177.5 12/24c he posted on Monday lmao next day MRNA was down like 10% üòÇ
I would wait
I have 250 bucks left thanks baba what should I get into?
I went with Jan 2022s
Anyone else wondering why the fuck they‚Äôre even playing this shit market today
Quit bag pumping. Ffs
I'm turning my phone off now
Too early to buy any BABA dip
Okay, I'll bite. Why?
I've lost $3k on this fine krimbus eve hbu

Me too. Puts and vix calls
What about 3 in a row, one good Green Day, two shit show red days?
The G*a*ME play is easily a minimum one month hold to four months, I wouldn't worry about a near future dip.  There has been plenty of well written DD, including rocket emojis, that have all basically indicated it's not a short term (one week) play.  Just my two cents on margin.
Anyone going cash gang? Or is this just a shorty red day?
Those puts ran bigly though
China basically released another wave of COVID onto BABA.
Nio and gme

i will never buy an FD ever again lmao

Yeah. I feel like some 1dte spy calls are the way to go even if stimmy and spending goes south. Fitute trades will buy anything, and not buying anything Friday and all weekend will have them acting like a heroin addict for their next fix Sunday night.
Alibaba
Yes
Cathie &amp; ARKG are failing me on Christmas Eve.
PSA: BABA‚Äôs IV has shot up to 50% from 35%. If you‚Äôre not expecting a short term bounce, you‚Äôll watch your options bleed premium while it trades flat/theta decay/IV normalizes
For real. Politics has become so insanely partisan from the last decade or two. Remember in the history books when they actually worked together and collaborated? God it's so awful. I used to enjoy political thought but it's so infuriating. [Picture from 1981 to now](https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5DJ7Q5OSKM3BJITK74FTSCNLLM.png)
Present ü§öüèΩ
That's Tesla for you.  The IV is so high it's impossible to make money unless you scalp daily.
Anything Chinese I don't really trust, I consider it high risk. The government has too much control. Some shit out of left field and all of a sudden the company is illegal to own or something crazy.
I dipped, need to clear my mind which is worth more than some more dollhairs
Yes hello? THIC?  Yes, I would like to file a complaint about your performance today. Your ticker very clearly has an ascending aeroplane in it.. what do you mean "risk"  Don't you hang up on me bi
The AMAZON of China is being treated like a penny stock just wow!

Bro ok all jokes aside   I don‚Äôt wish what happen to baba$ to anybody   Now it‚Äôs not even funny anymore dude   Wtf man   That‚Äôs shit is suppose to be a bluechip bruh
Me thinks that this is the bottom for baba.
Today‚Äôs redder than my girls period blood
I know it‚Äôs retarded to theorize anything on BABA at this point but someone answer me this: BABA was -8% down in Hong Kong and now we‚Äôre down double that amount(and counting). If the CCP is truly this child eating monster shouldn‚Äôt the natives have sold the fuck out?
yeah 3 day rule and all that but i couldnt wait.  worst case i avg down more later.
time to put the phone down and enjoy the holidays
Shyt, it better. Just BTD into a $45C.

Imagine losing money the year that QQQ gains 40%... just throw darts at a board next time
BABA dragging down Chinese stocks across the board.
Wake me up when it‚Äôs 2021
Merry Christmas/Happy Holidays to all retards and autists. üéÑ üéÖ
Alright well I bought every dip and jumped into pltr and plug, I have done my part, merry Christmas everyone
Bro, really?!?
Tell me why i shouldn't just buy weeklies on baba
Stop sell you fucktards. You already bout your Christmas presents.
Thanks for the BABA dip

Come on give us a proper dump. This is getting old. If every side is losing what‚Äôs the point of ‚Äúplaying‚Äù?

Good on you for cashing out. Take that profit.

Xi tanked every Chinese stock today to prove a point...hope it was worth all those billions.  Fucking commie idiots.
if arkg and f could not be bitch titties that would be great
Blackberry will be reincarnated, lol

Why nvda dump
Day before holidays is looking like they  print Palintir puts
That's a good idea. We'll see what happens. Zm has retarded strength potential so I wouldnt be surprised if it moons for no reason
I speak with zero authority or special knowledge but I would be watching any Chinese company closely.  The market requires respect for private property and China laughs and laughs and laughs at the concept.
I really want some NKLA puts but I keep thinking it'll tread water for all of 2021.
Are you feeling it now Mr. Krabs?
Baba fucking up my jd profits today.
Im feeling unwell
might be a good day to play the sin wave...you should be up a decent amount rn. maybe sell and wait for it to drop again, then buy back.
Me tio
No. Today 1 million shorts had to cover. We are at 4 million volume. Rest of the day is red and if we are lucky back to flat EOD.
Someone turn on the üñ®Ô∏è
Bought BABA dip from 280 all the way down, is this what Alibaba intelligence feel like?
Kind of a red day for me boys
Shorts trynna cover lol
The crush was extremely rapid from 10:30 EST til now. Much more than I'm used to.
Alright looks like I'm keeping my gme shares another week
guh    travel, financials, retail getting killed
BABA is on the rebound!
Blood red for me today. See you guys on Monday. Im out
Oh another dip to be bought up üôÑ

just bought NKLA calls....wish me luck
So many newbies in here who don‚Äôt realize when an Xmas sell off is this bad the post Xmas/January bull run is really awesome. I wouldn‚Äôt sell, but you can if you want someone‚Äôs going to buy the dip and everything will gap up so it don‚Äôt matter
Aids
Are chinese stocks a systemic risk for the rest of the market?
Or a great chance to load up?
Net positive on these DASH puts üòé
What do you mean?
Why would anyone buy options if they weren't expecting a short term bounce
enjoy this one win bears
Raise your hand if you bought ARKG after it 3x'd and expected it to keep going
I have 364 days left I ain‚Äôt worried lmfao
[deleted]
I doubt that the CCP cares about a bit of market cap in the NYSE. It's mostly just Americans buying and selling to each other anyway.

Welcome to communist china, BABA now needs to pay CCP tax to move forward.
Everything on sale
Why did I get spy puts yesterday, literally eveything else was free money
I'd like to meat jensen huang so I can spit in his fucking face for wasting my time.
Nothin better than dudes u know who have no idea what they‚Äôre doing putting random price targets on SPAC‚Äôs when they barely know what it is
Xi bought BABA weekly puts
üò¢
How many of u dumbies have options expiring today but don't realize markets close in 90 minutes? Don't let the early close cuck you!
Do you think Winnie Da Poo lubed up Jack‚Äôs asshole and is giving him a reach around or just giving it to him dry right now?  Puts on Jack Ma‚Äôs asshole.
CCP and Premier Xi to BABA holders.............. He steps in the single door. Gets his ass whipped with 20 lashes. Like that dude up in Singapore So Imma pull a fuckin Jeffrey Dahmer. Now I‚Äôm suicidal, just like Nirvana!!!!!!!
How‚Äôs it gonna spread when borders are closed from the US. The new covid is just fear mongering and who cares the europoors can dump all they want. That‚Äôs all they do anyways
It‚Äôs a victim of its own success at this point.  The amount of money in near term options literally went up over 10x this week and (surprise) most of that is in calls.  I‚Äôm now a conspiracy theorist but I absolutely believe people writing calls to make money will do whatever they can to keep options from being too painful on them and would sell shares to cause a bit of panic, might not work on a trillion dollar company but when you‚Äôre talking a few billy I believe they have influence.  Or I dunno maybe being up 50% in a week it‚Äôs not uncommon to have a red day here and there.  Regardless I‚Äôm not fucking leaving.
F I I I

I sold TSLA for ARKG yesterday ü§°ü§°ü§°

‚ÄúThe COVID-19 vaccine developed by China's Sinovac has an efficacy that clears the 50% level needed for approving emergency use in Brazil, according to a biological research institute in Sao Paulo state.  Sinovac has asked Brazil not to disclose the full results of trials of the so-called Coronavac for 15 days, according to the Instituto Butantan, which is overseeing the trials.  The Brazilian newspaper Folha de S. Paulo earlier reported the Coronavac had shown an efficacy greater than 50% in stage-three trials.‚Äù  Source[source](https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Coronavirus/Coronavirus-Free-to-read/Coronavirus-latest-China-and-Indonesia-ban-travel-from-UK)   https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Coronavirus/Coronavirus-Free-to-read/Coronavirus-latest-China-and-Indonesia-ban-travel-from-UK  "I'm worried that perhaps the efficacy rate is not so high after all," Dias said.

Not looking good for this one...
No problem, get out before the next leg up, though. üòä
It‚Äôs a Christmas gift. Time to buy
10% red day yaaaayyyy
Destroying shareholder value doesn't mean destroying the company.
This BABA segment on CNBC was actually very insightful.
Just buy calls
ARK funds are down about 1-2%. Why is everybody jumping out of windows?
Some guy bought in at $21.80 yesterday, but we‚Äôll all be laughing when it‚Äôs at $25 next month... ^^^maybe

Looking at the screen like Clark griswald..  Guess I'll return those presents now
Which large institution is invested in BABA? This might be the next Lehman moment.
yo tell me when its time to buy icln and ark leaps on the dip
This is the worst fucking green day I‚Äôve seen in a while
BABA makes $. $ wins in the end. I think this is more lip service to look powerful. The government loves BABA's success, they don't want to ruin it.
Went cash monday except TSLA. Really liking these pullbacks. You know top performing wallstreet chads dont have to trade on Christmas. They got their bonuses in the bag.
Products equal overheads. Hype equals liquid tendies. This is the way. /s

No way. Even if it is, the juice is not worth the squeeze.
Yeah. I bought these BABA shares for Christmas. They don‚Äôt fit. Can I get a refund?
It seems most stocks today are fucked. It‚Äôs just a Christmas week sell off. Only stock in my portfolio positive just barely is apple
Another reason I moved the fuck out at 18
Never actually played BABA before so that‚Äôll be interesting

With the clouds of CCP antitrust hanging over it? You do you, but I wouldn't try to catch that falling knife.
It's in a range, and will likely tap the lower bounds before heading higher.  For me, if it taps lower and starts to bounce up, I'll add.  I opened a partial position a few days ago.     [https://imgur.com/a/8Bd9PCw](https://imgur.com/a/8Bd9PCw)

I post a lot of retarded shit here but in light of Christmas:  If you‚Äôre feeling down on yourself or unappreciated, know that markets are inefficient. Be grateful for the people in your life who are there for you, and fade those that aren‚Äôt. Keep working towards whatever it is you‚Äôre doing and when the day comes when you shred ‚Äúearnings estimates‚Äù watch as all of a sudden everyone wants to be associated with you and your stock price goes to the moon. Your intrinsic value is hung like Hulk. Keep at it. Merry Christmas

Makes sense. There's still value because buyers could see a bounce
Yeah I bought GME puts  IM A VILLAIN IM A VILLAIN

BABA bull trap
I would guess they want ample time to actually close the contracts. some securities won't be as liquid you know? takes time to close in that case.
wait wat happen to buy the dip and don't time the market ?

So much red in my portfolio today ü§°
But are my calls fucked
I wouldn't, got off that yesterday AM. Seems like it got way overvalued.
Why is BABA delta always less than theta
April Mt calls taking a dump...time to eat them up
They had their anchor from Asia on and she stated that even China‚Äôs own state media is trying to bring calm to this situation, that this is because Jack Ma went too far with his criticism of regulation and the regulators are just trying to foster competition and growth for smaller companies. This is in no way to break up BABA or cripple their business because China wants a big player in the world market the way US has Apple, MSFT, Google, etc
Tsla looking like that struggle tree in Charles brown in my account right now
Currently down over $50k today. Not having a great time but it could be worse I guess
How do people get out of cheap covered calls when on Margin?  Putting new cash in doesn't let you buy options right away and will probably just lessen margin that give you funds to buy out options anyway.  It sucks being stuck in a 100 share position that only costs under $50 (with profit) to release.  Is it hard to get Naked options clearance from TDA?
QQQJ leaps are free money
Who the fuvk cares. At this point it‚Äôs moot until they sign the papers.
Maybe buying to close?
What makes you say that
Just lost 40% of my whole account; that was not very tight butthole.
I don't trust people who don't know the difference between "you're" and "your".
Just a dip, it always rises bb
I‚Äôd love a dip
2,000 stimulus will pass. Monster rally on Monday. Get ready üëÄ
source?
ü§£
Just got off the phone with a BABA investor.  Their initial findings suggest that the earth's core is made from nacho cheese. More to come soon as the dip continues.
So people selling China stocks because of Xi and jack ma having problems? Yea that‚Äôs a logical way to trade lmfao. Every company including baba sucks Xi‚Äôs dick. Baba shouldn‚Äôt even be overselling because jack nana being in trouble doesn‚Äôt mean shit for the companies getting oversold. Y‚Äôall are all just really that stupid aren‚Äôt you lol?
What dip did you buy?
If this is a sell off I can't wait for the bull run.
There it is like clockwork dip is bought. Do bulls not want proper prices?
Thank you gme and nio! Merry Christmas

Imagine being balls deep in BABA and living in Europe where all accessible stock markets (at least for Germans) were fully closed and you just sit there watching your money burn without any way of reacting...
Bullish or bearish?

So for the better part of the year, fundamentals haven‚Äôt mattered, now technicals don‚Äôt matter.  Boys, we‚Äôre trading on pure retardation now!
BUY MORE VLDR
Thcb news?
BABA can‚Äôt go lower than 0% YOY, right? right? guys?
No way we have a red Christmas right???
Word good lookin out
There's buying the dip and there's fucking with the Chinese government.
this is the worst tendie train ive ever been on.
Why
Make money with calls whether it goes up down sideway or backwards
Can you share a link for that PT?
see you monday
How much are you down
How fucked it is that congress couldn‚Äôt get their act together and pass stimulus before Christmas. It‚Äôs the kids I feel for think about the children who won‚Äôt get a Christmas you greedy fucks.
The real question is how large your overall portfolio is
WE CLOSE IN 1 hour 30 MINUTES
I totally agree, just nice getting some quick cash with calls. Up 40% rn and I have to hold to Monday because of PDT. I don‚Äôt trust this as a long term hold either üòÇ

I sold at 22 :D, rode it up from the morning for a solid 55% gain (5x leverage), but didn't want to go against meme energy, could go either way. Good play bro.
I‚Äôm no warren buffet, but you probably should have sold at open

People really in here saying ‚Äúbought GME at 20!‚Äù Like they actually think they made a good trade
You‚Äôre totally right, I was just concerned I‚Äôd be hit with a rug pull and forced to diamond hands all weekend so I sold out. What this proves yet again is that buying cloudflare calls on its dip days is the move basically every time.
Yeah maybe don‚Äôt buy the baba dip. We are coming up on CNY and could absolutely see an extended CNY is the vaccine they are using is not effective enough.
C B A T thoughts??
come on GME, what's uuuup
No BLINK needs to keep mooning üòé

The only upside of the dumb trades I made today, nothing really turned around so I feel like the dick only slapped me across the face once. It didnt come back around and plus the mushroom stamp.

TSA says highest passenger throughput yesterday since March.  Don't miss the 2nd half of the airline comeback story. UAL is good for what ails ya.
nice, bought a little more at $212 but now gonna wait another day or 2
They‚Äôre further out. I still believe $BABA is going to retest the ATH once there‚Äôs some clarity on this overblown situation.  BABA C 19FEB21 310  Bought at open for $0.80 per contract average.
So, govt shutdown on Mon? Pretty bullish
Ya know, I miss that limit up limit down days

Ok campers, who crashed my stock by buying a call? Not coooool dudes.
Ruined mine too fuck them
And some say their gains grew three sizes that day.  But very un-fucking-likely.
baba dumping 17% when in hk it was only down 8%. defnitely unexpected.
NVTA having a bad day, lot of their smaller holdings too
This is it. Baba bottom is in.
We wish you a Merry Christmas and No Money Next Year...
Next week
I'm giving it a few more days to deal with the shock of this drop.  I'm betting that the news and the market reaction will scare off a few more longs.  But overall, yeah, I agree, this will bounce back.
Looks like a red Christmas for me
Same bro, chasing pennies here...
This is where we excel
i thought she bought baidu, not baba.  Anyways wtf the only green in my portfolio was ark and now that's down too
probably some institutions trying to get out before year close. they have almost all the float.
Palantears üò¢
Everything selling off because people want money for Christmas.
Via con Dios!!!
Basically, she‚Äôs saying dont overreact. Situation is not going to be worst case scenario the way people are reacting. It will be resolved with some new rule that will foster growth and competition for smaller players (which China‚Äôs been trying to do anyway for the past few years). BABA, TEN and other big players will continue their path to greatness because China wants their own Apple, Google, MSFT in the world stage
How do we see which stocks ARK is buying/selling?
Profits before new year.  I think all the stocks that have had large runups are being sold off in high volumes.  I didn't get the memo unfortunately.
What re the requirements to receive the proposed 2k stimulus?
[removed]
techincals never mattered.
Time to buy
Buy the dip f****t!!
Plan is to lock in profits on overvalued meme stonks to buy more baba if it dips
I truly believe 90% of the people in here are genuinely retarded. You guys have to be with how irresponsible you all are. Hopping on the FOMO train inflating the price of so many unprofitable meme stocks. Yolo'ing entire portfolios. And then to act with disbelief when you blow up your entire account. Jesus....      This shit sure is entertaining though. Especially when the stupid plays end up working out. Merry Christmas you stupid motherfuckers. üéÖüéÑ

All my stocks are down. This is quad witching all over again. $ROPE ?
Yep, would have been a nice 40k profit about now‚Ä¶
So are we getting that $600 or nah?
Bough
None, we‚Äôre just waiting for DA and it rocketed way too much yesterday. Should be $13-14 right now, not $17.
wait till eod.
No
Yeah, but they do market orders and can sell way below actual value, so I can't imagine that wouldn't sell at 3:50 if it was ITM. That's legit free money for MMs.
buy the ai dip?
nice!  This is the strongest GME performance it's had this year,  it typically gives up a ton of its gains after a crazy day. Encouraging for bull in the short term
CCP can disappear ceos though...

Thats the rest of my buying power on GME $30 1-15. LETS GET IT
i was thinking they were just collecting shares but they should be done with that by now. i follow crsr everyday so i thought it was about time the institutional buys were done, they sell to drive price down so they can keep accumulating. rinse and repeat.
Luckin Coffee nods in agreement.
Owning a few long dated calls is the only $2000 stimulus anyone is getting.

Damn Palantir really gave me the shaft today
I think this also has to do with the questioning of the Chinese vaccine sinovac and the approach of CNY. If the vaccine is not effecting manufacturing after CNY is fucked. I work in manufacturing and am rushing all of my shipments out prior to CNY.

It doesn't protect against it as much as selling the opposite side, but your short leg will lose value to IV crush at a higher rate than your long leg.   I'd sell put credits personally here, though.

GME just playing with us right now, it will start to moon towards the end of trading hours
Sorry to tell you this,  but these breakup valuation wins might work in the western world but definitely not in China.

This has huge implications in manufacturing. If the vaccine widely being used in China is not effective it could reasonably trigger a delay in opening after Chinese New Year. Any real delay will cause delays across all spring shipments in retail... hard to keep the economy up and running if there is no product to sell.

It happened before. I remember, sometime in summer. Turned to be nothingburger, and good buying opportunity
I need that certainty.
OMG I thought I was buying a BABA call on the dip but I ended up with a BA call!  ü§°üòÇü§°üòÇ
Alright bois, it‚Äôs a Christmas sale today. Which means tendies next year. Which sales should I buy?
Christmas money plus stimmy checks, bulls are gonna have a field day
I bought the BABA dip and the dip won
CNBC will discuss SQ after commercial break
this BAbA dip is 100% gona make some lucky patient men into millionaires .
Sign up mail list in ark website. You will find out after eod
Tell me spy is gonna dump
Better buy FCEL rn boys
AAPL single-handedly propping up SPY
ARKG red today, big deal
Fuck you and a merry christmas to you too!  I‚Äòll have some more PLTR calls for you next week if you are interested :D
i think it's tesla which is taking the ark funds down with it as well as every other overinflated company on the bases of "well if tesla is X than we should be X/y at this point!"
I made some quick money on puts this am
People, every stock is down today or trading lower. Don‚Äôt be a üêªüåà have üôåüíé instead. Recovery Monday.
Fuck it, bought the BABA dip. Can't go tits up.
Winnie Da Poo is waving back at you right now
Just hold if they're longer exp palantir will make a move soon imo
Today boring af.  Just bleeding everywhere.  Chalk up another w for the fookin theta gang
-15% on a huge company is a black swan event
In this case it looks like someone dropped the card on the floor so it's not even in the deck.
Call up Cathie
Bet you it‚Äôs 51k
WAIT TILL EOD
Some of you will be alone on Christmas, and some of you will have lost a good amount today, but mostly it‚Äôs going to be both.  Stay strong lads, good times ahead! Focus on your health and well being. It‚Äôs just paper.
Badly, might post my next play as DD to inverse ü§°
DAMP IT MMs
Probably because of baba....China
Cue Waka Flocka meme: "oookk.."
So I should diamond hand my 2k shares?
We run this shit
Bid size 100 ask size 5 price goes up. Lol bro these MMs need to be hunted. Time to grab the pitchfork.
0DTE BABA calls is the play for 10 bagger
Yep - I'm more than happy to hold ABNB and sell calls every week
Cramer promising ‚ÄúSanta Clause rally‚Äù me buying 380c exp dec 31st ü§°
üçí
Arkg July itm leap. Paper handsed it yesterday morning on the dip. Took a solid $500 profit and waiting to get back in cheaper.
What‚Äôd he say?
Brexit trade deal.
Wow I just looked at Baba lol... tbh this looks like a buying opportunity. Baba still the e-commerce king in China. This is just like when they bring in FANG for their quarterly media harassment. Always bounces back
Small caps? Maybe?
Absolutely an overreaction. What incentive does the CCP have in ruining their most prosperous company? This overreaction to political theater is a huge opportunity for anyone with cash right now.
Just got into ICLN 4/16 32 C. Feel like this is a rather stable stock and can weather some hard shit the market gonna throw at it
head first
TSLA $700 EOD???
Hehe yeah we'll see
Nice, I went with 1/29 30c
So silly not to I don‚Äôt get it lmao
Meme stocks: Judgement Day
Like, i am more broke than when i fell asleep last night, but I am fine with it because I didnt wake up in a puddle of piss.
How is my entire portfolio red for the day, but the Dow still green?
Vix is down?
# next stimmy to fund cure for paperhands  üìÑüëê
90 shares of baba...fuck it
Yeah that hurt
#Ô∏è‚É£makeVIXgreatagain
$BABA #optionflowalert  Another Aggressive opening order  12/31 220 Calls bought at ask  OI 760 Vol 12,315  Someone spent 628K$
Thats amateur numbers.
ARKK bottomed out. GET IN.
At this rate QS might have to acquire BABA to save it
Did the right thing...
Any tax selling for the year will continue through Tuesday next week for full settlement
Time to buy the dip?
$BABA is Amazon of China
Samesies, inb4 delist, and getting absolutely cucked
Go BABA GO!
Welp I‚Äôm taking off went -15% this week, gonna enjoy the holidays with my family see y‚Äôall Sunday night for futes ü§†
Whoever said yesterday at close to buy OTM TSLA FDs, THANK YOU!
I would load up during this dip on ARKK
I've been holding the calls for a while now. I just wish pltr hit 30 so I could break even and get out.
\[i am very happy that pltr is going on sale rn\]
Dow is for boomers.
If it somehow drops below 100 for ARKG buy that shit asap
Anything running right now?
QS ain‚Äôt done running. All stocks take breathers and have mini corrections on the way up to shake out the paper handed bitches
And it‚Äôs gone
Bought the FUBO dip. Am I retarded?
Anyone else eyeballing AFRM
Thank you based Elon
Today is necessary so Monday is lit
&gt; Can't go tits up.  Are_you_sure_about_that.mp4
If you bought baba 1 year ago , you‚Äôve basically made 0 dollars holding Jesus
1000% this bitch will hit $18 by Jan 8
But they aren't sleeping on MT/steel plays though.
Nice poem poetryboy
Palantir took two days to reach that level of 29 and in the space of 15 minutes it lost it all, lolllll
Selling puts on this is profitable if you sell around 26-27
You say that, but nasdaq is even :p
Fuck are you spying on me?
Don't buy BABA options, the IV crush on Monday will rape you, violently.
Long BABA and Short GME...you must really love the soup kitchens
üëÜ
LIDAR...so hot right now
At least China is actually doing something about its tech monopolies. Our anti-trust processes won't achieve anything
Wait 3 days before buying the dip on big news like this for an individual stock
I'm delighted to announce that I will be BTFD on CRSR
nows your chance, i think ill add here
What time is the algo drop scheduled today? We still got 1hr 15 m
no its not like the FANG situation at all.  China is not the US. not by a longshot.
what if the real gains we made were the laughs along our journey? üòå
Wth is happening rn?
Time to avg down
Stop buying Tesla you fucks
It will print
yes. if the CCP were going to blow up BABA they wouldn't draw it out. They'd just do it .
NP looks too good of an opportunity to pass up, barely ran yet too still early
Good time to buy ARKG
Next Friday is New Year 2021! time flies! üçæüéâ
Look at FCEL in 2000.  Do you know what FCEL does?  Check their revenue and profit.  It is a dog shit company
Hop on SSPK before  its too late valued at 400m but I'm smelling a multi billion buyout from a big cannabis player come 2021.
BIG rise in C3.ai right now. About to see a powerful U and it wont stop until 200
Say the word then pussy
I‚Äôve got a 1/15 ARKG I‚Äôm just gonna üíéü§ö
What‚Äôs going on with BABA? Buy the dip?
30 dollars by 12/31 would allow me to be at peace.
New strategy for 2021
It‚Äôs already on way back up..
good! bunch of CIA scum !!
Gonna have to tell little billy he‚Äôs not getting presents this year because dad lost all his money in FD‚Äôs
Why JPow is not on WSB banner?
Portfolio Please Fly Again
20.69. Already had quite a few before the buy so it only brought my cost basis up a little bit.
Same here.  Everything I'm short is up, everything I'm long is down.  Payback because everything has been working too well.
Why so optimistic?
What is airt? ???
BABA green EOD
Wish I had a stimmy check to throw at it
not 100 for a round lot? at least you'd be able to write covered calls against the position for a while.   90 is like ü§°üî´
Exactly. Or passed out and woke up with a dick drawn on your face. You just opened up your account and feel like you should have one.
SMART! If senate goes blue in a few weeks, this is a 5% gainer instantly
have been waiting for this to happen. I hope it goes down to 90  so that I can buy some
BABA rising.
why do people insist on chinese stocks when we got all these delicious fucken US stocks at home
not yet
Don‚Äôt worry when I get mine I‚Äôll buy you a 4 for 4
one word: üêï
Haha yeah stock go down number get smaller
Lmao
BABA was down only -8% in Hong Kong but it's fucking down -20% here in America.
How is his wife holding up?
Reasons I hate China (in order of importance):  1.	BABA 2.	Concentration Camps 3.	Authoritarian Government
TSLA BABYüöÄüöÄüöÄ
Bought calls on the dips.  GME, NIO, PLTR, ARKG, VLDR
Wouldn't you first have to have a competitive market for antitrust to be relevant lol
Only reason it hasn‚Äôt is TSLA lol
You mean 0 to infinity
When the only green things in my portfolio are SPY and QQQ... what
Why would there be an IV crush Monday..
Naturally I sell my 0dte tesla calls for a little bit of profit and it goes back up $5 two minutes after I sell. üôÑ
Looking at BABA dragging down my portfolio...  ‚ÄúAlexa play Not Afraid by Eminem‚Äù
FEYE about to do that thing again.
It's already been dropping
eBay whyyyyyyy
S S P K bitches. Weedmaps is B2B and B2C SaaS üí∞ü•∞ü§ë
The prophecy has been foretold!
I think we just got fucked. There goes the profit I made riding this up.
Think about it  $BABA is Amazon of China with more 10+ times customers population
NASDAQ still green too.
-3.12%
Good idea. Might want to roll out further though.
366 or lower at close
Thinking about buying this SQ dip. Would i be fuk?
Market closes early today.
Lol maybe 100. Not 90
No BABA?
real talk the smart play is to not play BABA at all. too news driven.
Why is fubo tanking
Please. Fucking. FLY!!!!!
4. WuFlu
Green deal my friend green deal
Of course it's still massively down. We haven't recovered yet and we're far from it. That's why you can still buy airlines at 50% off pre-covid levels. The idea is to buy low and then sell high, remember?
Jesus. Even MGNI is taking a day off.
Same, this hurts. I just want it to hit 30 once so I can break even and gtfo.
BABA is a National Champion
Power hour is about to be sexy today
Imagine buying calls in a company that just announced they are under investigation
Nah
Before you know it, so probably now heh
Well shit. I should have asked for 8 days of gains then.
SPY chart lookin ugly
Did the VLDR CEO fuck Xi‚Äôs wife? Where my money gone
House GOP members are willing to give financial aid to Somali Pirates but not the American people? ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Shares on sale today boys, load up or miss out. Obviously market down on the 24th. January will see new highs. Trust me, I'm autismic
LEAVE CATHIE ALONE !
Bought March leaps we‚Äôll see if I fucked up
The poop canals didnt get you, huh?
This shit could dump harder
lol insane. huge gamble.
FüëÅ just presented the best buying opportunity if the day.... now will it finish green?
Sho reg gonna pump this thing fo sho
What are some good penny options or penny stocks to use up some of my last $2.41 of buying power on Robinhood?
How many shares do yall think Cathy bought out of Baba.  I bet you she is wet AF at these prices.
Buy the XL dip?
MT + VALE anyone?
Freakin WMT.  Will never do options of this POS again
Why EOD?
It hit 211 institutions shift to buy
Look at BLNK. That was riding around the 20-30 range for a while and then broke out and within a week it hit 52 where its at now.
hope you bought the dip
China hate is real in US, btfd anyways
Buy the AI dip
Literally everything red except almost GME. What a stupid day
Poor Burry. Does not understand how the market works. Call me Burry maybe ill explain it to you.
Not as exciting as other plays.. but WMT is set up nicely for a run up.
dam rip bro
Time for snap calls boys
Just transferred 10k, tell me stocks your bro should buy to hold for 2021
Merry fuckin Christmas MM's. Thanks for nothing.
Under investigation in China.
THE END IS NEIGH BROTHERS
When China decides you are violating antitrust laws....
Where's the santa claus rally I was promised?
Why what‚Äôs so magic eod?
MM‚Äôs keeping PLTR below $28 to shake out all the 12/31 volume. That‚Äôs why my big brain has 1/15 30c‚Äôs. Can‚Äôt wait to be rich
ARKK is down 2%. thats extremely v olatile for an ETF. and tesla is up for the day.  the next rug pull ARKK is taking a 10% haircut
got downgraded for being over valued
Cramer did warn us that christmas eve is almost always red.  Now what to buy
\*was
Yeah, but with a government that is going to show it who the boss is....

PSA: ALL FINGER BANGING MUST CEASE AT 1PM EST
Under investigation is what I said
Sell off starting
SQ launched a clothing line?  Dorsey‚Äôs losing his mind
everythings on sale boys
Hopefully 211 was the bottom.. I went in for a bunch
Or turn it into a spread?
The fcel shill is strong today. Gonna be a lot of loss porn when they dilute again.
CRSR. Ez 2X
**SRNE pleas fly again**
SQ, CRM
Dank. Please tell me you didn‚Äôt make that this year off the market or else I‚Äôll be incredibly jealous.
Started to lack funds, I had one queued up if it had dipped some more
Just threw 5 12/31 250c on BABA. TO THE MOON AGAIN
PLTR
Buy dip for shares
Okay, as long as we don‚Äôt lose more money I think we‚Äôre good....
It just goes down by $5 for every $100 you make above the $70k (single) threshold. It's higher if you're married or have kids.
[removed]
buy the dip, its gonna be 22 EOD
I $WISH that $AMZN, $PLTR, and $NVdAwould stop cucking me.  Breakout FFS already
cant kill national hero, but xi can stay crazy longer tha... solvent
Americans are racist who would have thunk
You‚Äôre right, if Baba falls, wish and pinduoduo can be the new kings of e-commerce
Dump Truck Hour you mean
I feel like a degenerate for positioning myself for a santa claus rally today.  Would suck if we drilled next week instead. Pass that fucking bill Trump.
dont have the money because my nio calls took a huge shit and i dont wanna exit any pltr shares-that's the goal in the next week or so though those premiums definitely get juicy
Everyone knows this doesn‚Äôt last
not if your bidet has one of those japanese-style hair dryers built in
i just posted that with no response
What a shitty day
We are almost at our power hour
Jack MA take the wheel.
NIO can you pleas fly back to 49 by eod tommorw
"Airlines are not an investable business" - Robert Crandall - Former Chairman of AAL.
Unlike Amazon in the US, there is at least one viable competitor to Alibaba in China (JD).
#PSA:  #Before betting on chinese stocks again,  #If you are in chinese stonks in any capacity, Xi is in you
Airlines. UAL, AAL, DAL, and LUV.
BABA actually got wrekt way more then I expected.
cept' tsla of course.
*üéµIt‚Äôs beginning to look a lot like cuckmasüé∂*
So I‚Äôll.... have a red, red red red Christmas
What do you mean, there‚Äôs lots of competition, more so than US tbh... they have PDD, JD. Here we don‚Äôt really have alternatives to Amazon
[deleted]
So glad my market isnt open to ruin my christmas
me and you will make money
You'd be up by ~48% if you bought everything equally
no
I thought the lockup period didn't end until March?
wtf's tsla doing?
TSLA keep going pls
Employees are dumping their shares, retard.  It'll be back up once that's done sometime in June.
Fuck those dinosaurs
Cmom Trump say some stupid shit on twitter again
Stimulus news ping pong cost me 3x 2K stimulus and 10x $600 stimulus in 2 days.  Bought back into SQ at strong support with a ton of momentum and NIO day coming.  Let the bodies hit the floor
Don‚Äôt think you know how IV works
Already got 10K of PLTR. Thanks for reassure
V shaped recovery BABA
Just yoloed half my account value on NIO 1/18 48c. Glhf

Already have CRSR. Thanks for reassure
Guhev
No fucking Volume whatsoever. Don't even know why I wasted my time checking the market.
Historically what happens between Christmas and new years? Buy season or tendie season?
Way overvalued in comparison
I think you might be a little too optimistic on this. Financials &lt; CCP.   A great case study would be Tencent. Again one of the largest companies but pinned in the past as out of control youth gaming did not fit into the narrative.
every decent SPAC's warrants are trading above $2, with no targets and deadline for two years. hahaha
do you hedge leap, synthetic equity, ? just learning leaps
The Krampus dick-drilling of ‚Äò20. It hurts.

Good stocks to buy on the dip today?

When the economy is on the brink of collapse, safest place to store your money is in mattresses.   Guess that's why PRPL is up 8%.
remindme! 7 days
It‚Äôs just market fear
Under investigation in China = not under investigation in China
BREAKING: Jack ma seen in Xinjiang camp learning basket weaving says CCP is the greatest.
I said a competitive market, not competition
If you‚Äôre not getting in on BABA now... you really do have a smooth brain
Calls
Honestly, I'm thinking about taking some off the table. This Tidal acquisition sounds dumb af to me and looks like they have more money than ideas. They should be spending time building products and markets that actually fit their core offering.
Hell yeah. That seems fair.
y'all about see a repeat of this monday happening again... the uk flu is gonna go crazy in europe
I'm getting assblasted by ebay, damn
I hope you sold man
Nobody really wants to authorize a trillion plus USD debt package right now when a new admin is coming to power in a month, it‚Äôs all bluster.  You‚Äôll see back and forth and then a week after we have President Biden we‚Äôll get (more or less) the same package President Trump nixed.  None of these people actually feel any of the pain that any American who is in the bottom 95% has felt this last year, all they‚Äôre worried about is optics: Republicans have to look like they fought hard to only do what was needed to keep the economy from dying, the Democrats have to look like they‚Äôre doing all they can to make the world a better place.  The more pain the people feel the more each party can tell their base ‚ÄúI fought for you, but the other side made this as awful as they could‚Äù.  Both parties are ass.
When you lie on your resume by saying you know how to ‚Äúmanage risk‚Äù knowing full well you lost $16,000 on 0dte‚Äôs in 30 minutes the day before.
GOEV is ear fucking me rn
You can just feel FCEL getting ready to break out and go wild üòà
Wow FDX bears really taking advantage of the low volume; under 1 million.
wouldn't be surprised if kodk overtakes babas mkt cap now that i capitulated
BABA 220C  pray for me.
ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è What's with these hard rejections. Am I in middle school agan
17% drop for a 700B mkt cap company is the biggest ive ever seen. runner up was AAPl down like 10%
My SBE calls have been crushing it this week. Have calls for March and may. This will run hard when the merger with ChargePoint is complete before mid January. IMO ChargePoint will be the leader in EV charging, in tandem with the Tesla supercharger network. I say this as a Tesla owner. I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs on peoples radar like it will be once it‚Äôs ChargePoint and not SBE after merging. Buy the picks and shovels, not the gold!
As much amzn PLUG ARKG as possible
Stocks closed you virgin
Fuck u for the gay day spy
Making a point of it being China.  Under investigation in America is a buy catalyst, its not like that in China.
Do you to your own taxes with tax software or do you go through a CPA?
Nice, my account is going to bleed out til close
GME
I pray to all the gods that it jumps next week.
BABA, SPY 220p, the world is your oyster
This year's Santa rally fucking sucked.
TSLA 0DTE FD Puts the play?
same price
Probably something to do with being up 500% in a month
It ain‚Äôt just the gop lmao it‚Äôs everyone in the shitty Congress. I think we need to get rid of all of em and start over personally
The algos stopped following his Twitter account in mid-November.
It's not the Amazon of China. BABA doesn't have warehouses, they are basically a storefront connecting businesses to consumers.   They're more comparable to Ebay if all Ebay users were businesses and not private sellers.
I would inverse WSB about 85% of the time LOL  I only say that because I tried to short it during the squeeze after open and I didn't realize that this is a fresh ticker
What do I've to do next? Calls? Shares?
Lotto baba calls for 2022 lol let‚Äôs fucking go
BABA ready to launch
Got my 200 dollars lmao
BABA 15% off Christmas sale, take advantage of it

Amazon doesn't go up till January
Bulls and bears are both losing. Dumps pre market recovers before open and ends flat. How are we not all banding together?
Yea you‚Äôre right.. China is going to hurt itself by bringing down one of its biggest companies.. makes sense. This is all politics and will eventually blow over. As usual this is overselling on fear. Revenue isn‚Äôt going anywhere, the company isn‚Äôt going anywhere. This is about as strong a buy that‚Äôs out there. Just don‚Äôt play short term.
Bought PLTR 29p yesterday after spending weeks throwing money at calls..  Woke up just in-time for ATH half an hour ago. Happy holidays, retards!  üöÄ
Thinking of flipping my ARKW to ARKK to consolidate. Thoughts? I also have ARKG, ARKF and ICLN
The tiniest of V's
Same here fellow autist.
Amazing he can weave basket with broken fingers.
LMAO the fact that I actually forgot about that. Wow.
ARKK ARKG baby
Cert
Go short on one and long on the other, call guaranteed profit.
No dumbass
Aapl with the daily pump and bleed..should close under 131
4. Fake Honey  I watched a doc about how they have a whole science lab just to test if honey is real or fake made from corn syrup in Germany. And apparently Xi, aka Winnie Da Poo eats soo much honey, China has to pump out fake honey to the rest of the world like it‚Äôs no tomorrow trying to pass it off as real.   Fuck you Winnie Da Poo! I see you! üëÄ
Hey did you know market closes at 1pm today
You can invest in literally any company that didn‚Äôt come out as possibly being corrupt and it would be a better option.

Hmm please stop tanking
Thats probably for the best

I bought July
NIO day on the 9th or something?
Orange man is probably just barely making the turn, tweets won't come until after market closes.
Depending on the stocks they're picking, both could be winning big today.
Good, I‚Äôve seen so many wsb millionaires it‚Äôs scarring lol.
UPST
Historically its a 70% chance of green days over the next trading week however Stim/US Budget/COVID adds volatility this time around
0dte?
Imagine being a GME short heading into a 1pm close, with a 3 day weekend and wondering if you'll even have a place to live next week.  Let's go.
Well fuck me then
Depends on how much money you made. If you can afford to spend 500-1000 on a quality cpa, do that because they can save you taxes in ways you never imagined.
Liquidated my position for ~30% loss. Taking the rest of the year off. Could be worse right?
Glad I held off on fomoing into it
Not the best day ü§î
Everything hurts except tesla
ARKF?
‚ÄúARKG seems a bit too high‚Äù says my relatives who bought PFE @ 41
You know, there's stupid and then there's really, fucking stupid. It should be obvious that you cannot front run an economic recovery in the commodity space. Because if a bunch of boneheads bid up prices of key commodities like steel or oil, then the recovery never happens and demand stays depressed. Sell that shit and move on.
all hail Xi Jinping. no one in the US has the balls to do what he did. Big tech is too powerful lets be honest. I gained alot of respect for him srs.
SANTA CLAUSE SIGHTING. POWER HOUR HERE WE COME

Santa rally is the last week of dec and the first 2 trading days of jan
They shoulda just closed the fuckin market today
I don‚Äôt hold BABA &amp; my port is BLOOD RED. Help ! SEND HELP!!
Come on ZM, close above 380 to give me some semblance of hope going into this weekend :/
Why good day to buy? Think it will continue that to rip like it did?

SPY be like: I‚Äôm gonna thetabang-bang you into the night.
Yawn. Dudes like you been telling me this shit since i got in close to the bottom over the summer. Keep telling yourself people are going to just stop flying and airlines are dead while more and more get vaxxed every day and are dying to go somewhere. I'll keep counting my profits.

Your not doing it right then. Play the morning reversal with shares and collect premiums from the dumbasses who think it will tank or spike in a week by doing covered calls and puts. PLTR is literally such easy money.
What‚Äôs inbetween a paper hand and diamond hand? Could‚Äôve had 28k profit but came out with 19k from my Tesla calls. I was selling portions throughout the day.

I let them ride an then my short term plays with my hedges usually balances everything out but I couldn‚Äôt predict this shit was going to happen so I wasn‚Äôt set up properly
bought the BABA dip with shares and calls.  to put things in perspective BABA makes 50% MORE revenue than AMZN at 1/3 the PE ratio..... if this was an American company it be $500 easy.
Buffet called and he said buy the BABA dip f*ggot ,   Also ret*rded censorship rules at reddit, what is this Gyna?
Overreaction for baba ? Do calls for 2 weeks from now might cash in ?

Mango was right, its chinese virus!! Baba killed whole mArket!

WSB has lost its meme power. Maybe we can pump something for a day or so but I'm not sure we will see weeks of running anymore. A month ago PLTR and NIO was making everyone stupid gains for weeks  straight
Nah I'm fucked as of today.  So pissed I didn't sell my options s yesterday when there was hope

Probably bounce but I wouldn't hold the bounce.
It‚Äôs been bouncing between upper resistance and lower support trend lines the past few weeks, forming a bullish pennant, and in the next few days it‚Äôll have to make a decision. We could see it break 29.5, 30, 31 and after that it‚Äôs clear sky‚Äôs üöÄ

I choose to believe the only reason my account has seen so much alternating red and green this week is to be festive in the spirit of Christmas. I just need the festivities to end on green by EOD
xi jinping was upset so he made a few calls and shaved off 300B mkt cap from the biggest company in China. Let that sink in.  All hail lord Xi
Keep selling covered calls on PLTR through Jan?
That's what I'd suggest, as long as it is within your risk parameters - e.g. not making your portfolio too dependent on just this one company.
Got them too.
depends on how much money the central party members have invested in BABA and if they have  exited already.  If they haven't, this is a good plan to let the world know Xi is in charge, teach Ma his place, while also allowing party members to get a better entry point before letting the probe give him a slap on the wrist and it rebounds.

Finally in PLTR on this low volume dip. Let‚Äôs üöÄ

Somehow only down $10 for day...
that's pretty good. kinda feels like when I bought BA last year at $330.
Bottom is in boys, back up the truck and load the fuck up
Would it be a good idea to hedge my BABA calls with one or two puts expiring next week?
you donkeys have pushed STIC up way too far to get a good entry. I guess I will have to wait until options are available and sell puts to get assigned.
shit manipulated as fuck so you got a chance

It's probably not too late to get in on FRHC if you want to be a buy and hold investor instead of a wsb options gambler
So this bullish or?
Time for a Christmas miracle power hour?

Wish I hadn't paper-handed 0-day TSLA 660c. Shit's printing without me. :/

I surf the waves for sure. I just think there is a lot of counter measures from the outside being taken to make sure WSB isn't as much of a MM as it previously has been

Every stock is in red. What a way to celebrate Christmas üéÖHo Ho Ho, Merry Christmas!
I agree. This will be the third red week in a row. Last time it happened was in March it shot up like 19% the following week. I'm hoping for 10% increase before 1/15

270 -  jan 2022
Yes
I am literally pumping everything I have into baba calls at $200
Story time: Last Friday I held two FCEL 9c till expiration. I was under the impression TDA would close them automatically since I didn't have any buying power but I wake up Monday with 200 extra shares and an $1800 margin call.  I'm still holding the shares which are up 30% today. I sold half of them yesterday when it went over $13. I'm just gonna hold and see how long TDA will let me keep them. If it pops again I can sell enough ccs to cover my margin
Are markets closed early today?
Thats what I think. I sold puts on it. So if it goes down I am screwed.
HERE. WE. GO.
We all did lol
One hour to go.  Power hour or sour hour?
Okay, I‚Äôm in a 40% position right now... looking to DCA over the next few weeks. Any idea when SSPK is expected to merge? I read Q1-2 2021
Damn. Anyone here have BABA calls before today? On the other hand, anyone here have puts?
Any dips to buy at close??

I just bought RKT
Go find Bezos for that
Not very Sneks today
BTFD on BABA.    It's basically a national champion for tech.  China will not break them up.  They will add regulation so Alibab opens up the 1 or 2 option to other retailers, but Alibaba will still be dominant because economies of scale.  Alibaba also has the best research in AI in China.  And AliHealth is huge.  just BTFD in stocks for your retirement fund.
You got to grab baba at 215 man  Do people really think the government is going to shut down the network that powers 45% of their exports
Friend of mine sold his BABA calls for a 35k loss.. he was even a few days ago

Alright fine business can be hard, let‚Äôs take away all the tax breaks then.  And the FED is designed to help control inflation by adjusting interest.

I'm disappointed that I bought into the hype of MT. I'll let these calls crash and burn so that I can learn a lesson and become impervious to FOMO.
Why are we red
I‚Äôd sell. I played fcel for a few weeks but never held overnight. It traded between $7 and $12 like clockwork before the last dilution. They got some good news and I‚Äôd say $14 is probably the top of the channel now. I bought late yesterday and sold at close to get out even. Or, I could be wrong and it goes up next week. I don‚Äôt have enough faith in the company to hold it.

China is bending BABA over and getting ready to fuck them for the next few months.   Reddit: time to buy short term calls   This is worse than tanker gang and mattress spam put together.
*Buy low sell lower BABA gang.*
145k puts ITM right now on SPY, look for a facerip at the end of the day when they get flushed out. I'm loading 0DTE 369C's for $2 each as lottos.

This sucks. German brokers are closed. I have BABA calls and stock and I can‚Äôt do shit but watch my money evaporate on Christmas Eve
Yuck

The idea that Bezos sends out dick pics is so cringe that I think the fed should take over AMZN before China takes over BABA.
BABA you fucking piece of shit get back to VWAP at least

dips is being bought up üéÑüéÖ
I love chevelle too, just not actually seeing that shit
I can live with a red day that looks like this. A day where my portfolio is down this much but SPY is still green would piss me off.
Dear VIX, u gave us Christmas in March. Now, how about Christmas in December Thanks! Your friend, Bearly Legal.
Man December really sucks fucking ass. I thought this was gonna be such a huge month after the election but nope... flatter than my sisters tits
The "Analyst" that gave FUBO the $8 price target has been barred from FINRA to act as broker or associating with a broker-dealer firm. He's trash.
Imagine a world with no war and no weird shit.  Just business and pumping stocks and Brrrrr money printing .  Life would be so much better
Should I dump Nio or is it legit?
OMFG WHICH ONE OMGERZZZ
God damn eBay
I am for the ones I just bought at 215 Jan
Yeah 12/31 my bad

"xi does not play"  - xi's mom
What‚Äôs the ticker?
PLTR
Yes! I didn't think Jack Ma would let this drag on for so long, but the fact the big boys closed their millions of dollars bullish options after todays drop is not a good sign
Fr I just saw the headline that said ‚Äústocks up...‚Äù. Which ones!? had to double check my shit because like 13/15 of mine are red lol
YOLO'ed into BABA calls
hey ma we got chicken or what?? MA!!!
Still a negative fuck on people, threw a few hundred to my local pet shelter though
Let me explain what‚Äôs going on: this year sucked for normal people and kids, they are pissed off cause they had to cancel Disney vacations this year, couldn‚Äôt go play outside and shit.   Enter Christmas and kids want something big to make up for the shitty year, they want a PS5, but we all know that the only ps5s are like 10x normal price  and since this fuckers didn‚Äôt give us our stimulus well what can you do as a dad???  Obviously sell your stocks to buy some nice presents
How old are you?
just taking advantage of this hive mind is all hahaha  It‚Äôs only a problem when the lil guys do it üôÑüôÑ
Been that way all week. EV and Apple pumps combined are a whole new level of meme.
I see lots of ppl here getting some NKLA &amp; LK treatment with their BABA. Literally giving away their hard earned cash to GYNA, poor shmucks
Yeah but his puts probably printed bigly lol
Idk what you‚Äôre in but I‚Äôm up bigly this montj
More than we'll end up getting from stimulus.
Fuck it going in on BABA
I'm not an alcoholic, I'm just addicted to seeing you pretty.
There‚Äôs a feeling that goes along with buying FDs. It‚Äôs not always positive. It often has fear, frustration or the sense that maybe you‚Äôve bit off more than you can CHWY.  But doing the real thing matters. Days wasted on "investing" may keep you busy, but they never seem to go anywhere. A life spent on real risk may not always be the easiest or most stable, but it‚Äôs the one that might pay in the end.
I sold my BLNK puts too early. Lost out on $2300 of potential gains. But made $1600. So not too shabby. Off to bed üõå üò¥   BABA September 2021 285c!!! üöÄ
100 shares of aapl and sell calls on it

Imma fire all my YouTube Technical Analysts. BABA red. PLTR red. GME short squeeze.......not happening. They told me TSLA was overpriced and not to buy, yet TSLA going to the fucking moon.  FML ü§ïü§ïü§ïü§ïü§ïü§ï
Yeah, to his new gf while he was still with his wife.
And how does that work?
Haven't gotten out, down like $2k on the day right now but I could see it maybe ending right around 20, I expect a bump next week though once there's real volume back in it
Pleas post BABA loss porn
How is spy green? Everything is red from my watchlist lol
[removed]
For all you that worship ARK, didnt they just buy BABA like two days ago?
5k MSFT  5k AAXN  5k in literally any 10 random SPACs that are &lt;11 as lottery picks  Forget about MSFT and AAXN till you're old, sell any SPAC that is up 60%; glhf

I blew up my account today. Fuck
BABA IS ANALING ME I NEED A REBOUND PLZ

AMZN been buying up used planes to build up a fleet and Amazon is 22% of their business. That's why Bezos stock been flat too. One of the reasons UPS didn't provide guidance. Holiday hiring numbers was out since October.
No fun. This is money. Go all in on GOEV and forget about it.
If you dont mind sickening volatility NVTA is great for swing trades

If you want to fly high you‚Äôll need a RKT
Something that is currently priced lower than it should, or recently was.
Yes let‚Äôs just sell everything
Sir I want my 2k stimi. My calls need to refuel.
Aw fuck i fucked it
No I didn‚Äôt, but business that did can still speak out against it. Everyone is going to operate in their best interest, if the government is giving out free money of course you take it to stay competitive with your peers, but you can still hold the opinion that they shouldn‚Äôt.
Which is good for smaller competitors. Long stonks
[removed]
sounds good

Just another day? I doubt it. Their Christmas is entirely capitalist driven
That‚Äôs a good father. Mine did something similar but 1k only.   Just start getting a feel for the market. Honestly this subs advice might taint you lol

When are we expecting for FCEL to go back up again?
The dip?? How do you know? It is the most random anti trust probe i've ever seen. China's financial markets are obviously way too political

*Bwadadedidlerdow*
Nah that sell off was fake af, market clearly going up Monday
PLTR super lame now.
I actually can‚Äôt recover anymore. Baba is dead and I lost my house
They are absolutely bum programs that should be eradicated, people love to talk about how wages have been stagnant since the 60s, coincidentally the same time all this big welfare started up.
what part of   Only the Rs are fighting against anything that helps the people.  don‚Äôt you understand
Well regarded
There we go
Mark my words ALIBABA WILL OPEN AT $180 Monday then gap up after to $240
I swear I‚Äôve been doing this shit with a bunch or tickers over the past 3 months
Buy high sell low
Dump in last 30m almost guaranteed.
You have two paths you can take:  Put it all in mutual funds and safe etfs  Yolo it all on meme stock calls
Presuming people start to wean off the Covid news, I'd think that with a Dem. presidency and possible house flip, the focus will be back on climate change initiatives
Hey man, you do you üôè
Happy cake day
Buy low, sell lower
You leaving money on the table if you dont buy spring-mid summer calls on BABA
Wow. Glad I jumped out of EBAY. Dafuq is going on with this stock, nonstop declining
Pls fly again ü¶Ö
eh
PSTH June calls will print bigly
It will flop around from free money to worthless back and forth all week as is customary.  Just close them out when they are green and don't try to time the waves.
Does Bombardier have the opportunity to go to the moon i currently bought 4000 shares YOLO
Nio.
ICLN barely even dipped tho
Got in a couple of years ago heavy at $40. Been my best move. See you at $300!
is it safe?
People did that yesterday and now its down $40  So no
True. BABA is so undervalued though, even moreso now, that the government could take pieces and it would still be a good stock to own. Obviously depends on what they take though.
People have been killing each other since the dawn of time, thats a retarded thought to have.
Fingers crossed ü§ûüèº

Hello MMs I was promised something about a 13th day surprise for GME because it‚Äôs on some exclusive VIP only guest list
BABA calls easy 5 bagger
that retarded spy bounce just raped my puts. cool cool cool
Been thinking of this for a while lol, will dump it once it arrives at 55.. hopefully by January
Dont just sit there watching your stocks drop like flies, get in where the getting is good. C3.AI (AI) is on the move to 200 eod. Pum pump pump it up.
Don't catch a falling knife.
Power hour ?
All I neeedddddd is a miracle All I needdddddd is a rug pull allineedisarugpull
Holy fuck.
So this stimulus scenario has turned out pretty much as bad as it possibly could have huh?   Nice
Shorts probing stop losses on GME rn
It's okay boys. I remember this all too well. It was Christmas Eve of 2018. Everything was blood fucking red but then a Christmas miracle happened. Mnuchin activated the PPT and with their ample liquidity, boxing day was the greenest MF day I've ever seen. Since boxing day this year is on a Saturday, I have no idea what's going to happen.
closed my CLF calls yesterday at a small profit. holding on MT Mar 19 '21 $30  though
BABA c 215
this is just robot wars.  we are all just along for the algo roller coaster ride.  That sell off yesterday in the last 10 minutes was utterly absurd.  The entire s and p 500 chart looked like it had an infinite slope at the end of the day yesterday. Now a big dip with a stupid bounce up.  Computers are assholes.
waiting for it to do something since weeks ago, it only went bad, maybe it'll move with the deal
[removed]
Please do your part this holiday season to strong arm rob your local console hoarders $SNE
SNAP why you go down ü§åüèª ya fuk
Think it will actually go above $50 again?
They also post clickbait titles and thumbnails saying March 2.0 is coming every week so
It‚Äôs just contract after contract dude, conference on the 6th I think and then live demo on the 26th followed by earnings after, strong chart, strong competition, what else... oh yeah üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

It's Early Power Hour; BUY any dips--statistically, the days after Christmas Santa rally. + upside on stimulus. Let's go!!!
10k in GME shares
Thoughts on AAL calls? March-May?
Man so weird the concept I bet must of us have for money now. Down 3000 this week but said wtf when I bought my girl makeup for 70 bucks lmao
If you bought BABA on July 1st, forgot about it until now, and then checked your account you'd have about the same exact amount in your account as you did then.  6 months for nothing.
Why would anyone, who's not Chinese, invest in Chinese companies?
It remains illegal for AMZN to have a good day
Then watch it go higher.
Fuck it, I'm in on MVIS. Let's see where this goes!
haha
STOP THE COUNT
Why the fuck did I buy TAK leaps? Cathie pls
Shares on BABA is the play. It's now 100% of my 401k at $218 average
Correct. Chamath might be the next one after Cathie.
Aside from politics which is very iffy if repubs keep senate-- it really depends on how the fund is actively managed. For example, RUN was biggest holding in October.  Now it's PLUG.  If they move and shake right and politics helps, could be lucrative. Personally, I think most of the big plays in the sector are exhausted and won't have earnings growth to justify these valuations.
Why tf is alibaba down 15%? Is there any reason?
[https://www.reddit.com/r/scamthescalpers/](https://www.reddit.com/r/scamthescalpers/)
Volume is low. Expect a dump of all dumps after the gains the past couple days

I recently found my brokerage app can chart option price history. Some of these contracts take wild rides.
GME long squeeze
Listen if you get paid my March 300 make money - let‚Äôs hope
Game stop. Technical analysis. 20.20 is the floor for the Gme and the people. Only up from here. Add 10. 30 eoy price target.
It‚Äôs power hour! FCEL, get your shit together and shoot up!
Senate rejected the revised bill today because they kept all the foreign money the same just increased the payments to 2k which kind of misses the point
How do you say tendies in retard
You‚Äôre retarded if you think BABA will go lower
I think 212 to 217 was short covering personally. Not a lot of motivated longs out there imo
Most obvious dead cat.
Beautiful dip on GOEV today.
Why's today RED?
90%ptlr gme stic, then 10% in some boring blue chip stocks
Enjoy being a hobo
Roughly 220k. I made a second mortgage after it dropped to 260 and bought half calls half shares.
Down
PLTR keeps building lower lows it‚Äôs still bullish AF
Fake bounce you‚Äôll be fine
I have never seen a more obvious setup for a blindingly green Monday. Buy the dip fellers
It‚Äôs bleeding on extremely low volume, wouldn‚Äôt worry about it
Because $ to be made retard,
Goes down, yes.
When is Modena going to bounce back
to steal their gains
Jack Ma said the n word
Boomer stocks win today
Can confirm this works.
Its going there!!!
The BBBY 01/08/20 20C was 1$ today. Is that the floor?
180 is my 2nd entry but seems pretty low to hit on Monday.  But you went from 5k to 500k so what do I know.
Stimmy is fuk
everything
I'm going all in on CHKAQ.  TO THE MOON!
Literally google it and read any of the top 10 news titles
China is the future.
The house will pass the $2k stimi Monday buy buy buy!
Riskier than arkk, but has big potential. Those pharmaceutical companies moon hard when they get good trial results or approval for new drugs
ARKG 4/16/21 $140c  Just bought 100 of them  This dip is a blessing, please do the same. Thank me later.
Closes at 10 right?
Chinese government proves if they have a monopoly
If SPY ends red, buy calls.
Fuck you bezos and jack ma
But all your cash in $GAY. Not kidding.
BABA is opening +5-10% on Monday. The anti-trust news is overblown.
Yeah, but trump is a dip shit lol I think once he is not longer and office, hopefully the negotiations with china stop being shit, actually if that happens it may moon as it should
AAPL kept up the momentum. VLDR and LAZR on the other hand...
That was the move clearly
Let‚Äôs say I have an ITM debit spread on 12/31 and I close the short leg eod 12/31 and close the long leg 1/1... is there any rule against claiming the short leg as a loss for 2020? Or is that covered under the irs definition for ‚Äústraddles‚Äù
What time the market close today for Pacific time?
Rmg!
Soon, play is for 18-20 dollars
Idk how weedmaps makes money but I'm bongs deep in sspk
SPY is green still.
LETS GO
FDX went down $10 today after it‚Äôs high of $276, with the only news since then being a price target upgrade.  Yup makes sense.
Yup....       People love to talk about 100% option yolos around here, but only retards do that.        If I had to guess, most WSBers are invested in high volatility stock of small to mid cap companies which might double over the next year.  They also probably play options too, but its a much smaller amount of their account than the stocks.  Still super risky, but not retard risky.
I‚Äôve been staying away from BABA this whole time, but I bought calls for next week. Just a small position. Think it‚Äôs at peak fear here.
My gains got run over by a reindeer
BABA RED -&gt; My port that does not have BABA RED = Cyber Covid Virus ? ü§î
It‚Äôs finding it‚Äôs support at around 18.20s also there are signs of an uptrend coming. Give it another week or so before anything drastic
Lol, we thought the shorts would give up on GME. Nah, these idiots are digging their own grave deeper
Well that was a Federal Intervention bounce if I‚Äôve ever seen one.

Can anyone explain why this company which had less than a dozen employees last year is worth so much money?
Ford should make decent ICE cars. They had 50 years to beat the Japanese and couldn‚Äôt.   EVs are too much. They should stick to the F-150 (no joke).
Maybe, just maybe, institutional money was what was keeping the market green all along

As more states legalize weed, Weedmaps revenue declines (they‚Äôre forced to cut ties with unlicensed shops and deliveries once a state goes through legalization).  Weedmaps business model is built on profiting off of the black market aspect of weed.  This will be a pump and dumper

Why's GME going down?
happy cake day! üíéüñê
It‚Äôs legit and will have a run up before Nio day on the 9th of January
Literally no one even knows about it yet. Did PLTR or CRSR take off immediately? No, it took time
üß†
GME weeklies dude is it even a question, week after Christmas gonna make GME moon
Republicans spend money like it's 1999 when it's a republican president and force capital hill to pinch pennies during democratic presidencies

Alright market. Sell off until close. Let‚Äôs get this over with

Yeah that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm asking for a rebound..
200 more shares GME!
Damn, why you hate your sister that much?
MM's successfully bound PLTR to 28 this week. This war is a long one but we are slowly breaking them!
Thanks guys, but losing all my money in baba was really my own fault
Supreme leader Winnie the Pooh thank you for the BABA discount
GME profit taking incoming tome to scalp puts
Can we make it a temporary honorary meme stock then?  Partnership with Walmart, PT upgrades, vaccine distribution, busy holiday shipping season. Fuck

Took a nap. I was green. Woke up red. Merry fucking Christmas
Motherfuckers, SPY leaps will print. QQQ leaps will print. AAPL leaps will definitely print.   Instead everyone is grabbing 12/31 GME and PLTR calls like true goddamn ü§°s
yes.
Blame the CCP
Don't matter, if they failed today already shows Republicans aint having it.
Calls going up in value on flat MU trading...
That‚Äôs okay I just enjoy your stories grandpa
40 minute full thrust üåù
But think about it though. the Santa rally comes because of people's merry moods after holidays, right? This Christmas is gonna be complete shit. That should mean the market is gonna be shit, too. And if the market is shit, inexperienced investors are gonna sell out thinking "Why isn't it up? This is supposed to be the Santa rally!", causing stocks to go down even more and leading to a correction of &gt;1 percent.   &amp;#x200B;  Just my two cents. I hope I'm wrong.
Starting to see that lol
Once again I here to announce that door dash is pumping on very little volume.  Very cool, very legal!
It has almost 2 billion issued shares
Jack Ma said some pretty funny shit about Xi and Xi is making an example out of him. This isn‚Äôt gonna bode well for baba

Glad I sold the 12/24 GME 22C's for a profit of 10 bucks earlier, haha. Bought right near EOD yesterday.
I'm tellin' you bitches, BABA has a few more days of dumpage before it turns around.  But don't listen to me, I ain't learnt shit.  "iT's *bO*unCin*G"*  Nope, downtrends have pullbacks just like uptrends do.
wall street still mad about the direct listing
BABA coming back to life üêÇüìàüöÄüöÄüöÄ
GHI.v is definitely gonna POP as they have a meeting Jan 20 to affirm everything. Calls before then.  It‚Äôs still cheap in terms of SPAC‚Äôs ~ $13 range currently  Jan 15 $15c for a 5 bagger maybe more.

Of course Brexit goes through then $BCS sinks like a stone. The sell the news plays are kinda tough because you have to sell IMMEDIATELY on the news or you're too late. Now I'll wait for re-entries on $BCS to sell.

On the next episode of wallstreetbetZ
They have 125 clients that on average give 5M each, and return each time. From the new contracts we saw, they get much more than 5M per client... 80% margins, you do the math! üöÄ
Could of got out up 1k at 11 am now down 4k. Marry fucking Christmas
But buy investing in China you're actually making that happen, without foreign investments they wouldn't be anywhere near as well off as they are now, and by helping them you're negatively influencing the US economy, meaning there will be less good jobs here.

What y'all thinking about ZM calls? Going to be added to the S&amp;P on January. Buy the dip?
Is this good or bad for ARK? Cause they might be buying a very problematic asset
Finally, we won't have to hear about brexit talks anymore.
Don‚Äôt quote me but look at that volume. We‚Äôll see after close. Hard to imagine they‚Äôre not adding today considering they just bought shit ton of BABA two days ago

If you feel down about your positions just remember this volume is ass berries, all the big dick bulls are home eating turkey and will be out banging their side piece tonight. They will come back Monday and see this juicy dip and slap that buy button with their big bull weiner.

Of course you would take it, who wouldn‚Äôt.  And that is the very role the government is intended to fill.  Imagine if they hadn‚Äôt bailed out the banks or motor companies from 2008.  People wouldn‚Äôt be saying ‚Äúso what, that‚Äôs business.‚Äù  Hell imagine they hadn‚Äôt passed the CARES act this year?  At what amount do you decide it‚Äôs okay for a pandemic to kill hundreds of thousands of people?  Millions had they done nothing at all.
Puts are down 50% lmao

Lucky bastard. Imo its a super underrated stock that not many are looking at
BABA dipped 8.63% on the big lockdown back in March... this is insane.
Short squeeze Man the banks have to unwind their shorts as buyers rush in its simple
Did anyone here play BABA 0 dte puts at open? How much % gains you make?
AAPL abyss
I bought $250 LEAP's... Should fill today's gap and go ITM soon.
Christmas üéÑ numbers could be pretty bleak this time. Even Black Friday was nothing much to talk about
That is the way. Leaps on SQ
[removed]
That‚Äôs a good point. Are you expecting as big of a run up in price as there was for the last two generations in consoles?
I bought calls on the dip. Its a blessing
Baba really is that play today that next week everyone‚Äôs going be like fuck it was so obvious
I can tell Sarah Eisen is some where else because her lighting is so different. Looks like she's in her in-laws bedrooom walk-in closet.

No fucking humidity
Microsoft was built in a garage. They knew their market. They are what they are now. AI is the next money saver for companies. Talkin a platform where companies can develop code without as many human bodies involved. Speculation is going to be so 2020 when this thing moons in 2021. Why do you hate money?
QS needs to drill here
Nio
Already all in pltr
And GME is still a bad business.
Lots of bagels in the morning, and some alcohol
Sorry, that sux üòî
Shout out to the fucker who keeps dumping after every rip
GME is slowly dipping fellas. It means how things. Short holders are desperately trying to drive the price down, which means if it dips below 19 get back in with every spare dollar you can afford to lose. This thing is gonna jump back up next week at some point. Again, shares, not options. No weeklies retards! If you‚Äôve been selling at the top and buying at the bottom consistently with GME you‚Äôve already been printing money. Get in now because we‚Äôre either getting a MOASS or just the stock returning to its actual value, which is way higher than any of the mainstream cucks give it credit for.
‚Äúfacing no repercussions‚Äù   ultimate bull flag
Going to need Mango to sign the bill.  GOP - get your boomer in order
imagine if BABA V shaped back to 250 in 30 mins
Dude this nio drill is uncalled for
GME right guys? Where did the confirmation bias queers go?
Once again selling BABA puts was free money.
If anyone needs evidence, just watch the interview with Elon. LMAO what an absolute retard! An average WSB user probably knows more about machine learning than Ma.
BABA Calls? Sell at close?
Blood in the street, I will sell Baba in a few minutes and buy even more GME shares
From one guy who likes free money to the rest of you, get in on ALPP as soon as you can
Why the fuck isn't the market open tomorrow. Red and green, it's what Jesus would have wanted.
The baba dip will be remembered all of 2021
Right, and with holidays (11/11, Black Friday, and Christmas), they should be report a great Q4 2020 in Feb, I‚Äôd assume anyways..

Never. That's disgusting

Hope you recover bro try to work and make some bank next month to make payments to both mortgage and margin you might survive this
Don't forget Bang Ding Ow
What do you guys think about cruise stocks? Basically guaranteed to shoot later on and constantly go on sale. Also because space lingo is a direct copy of boating lingo, does that mean confirmed moon??
Okay? I'm talking about literally 99% of them not the few vultures who shorted GME after a 7 dollar gain in 2 days
I actually prefer morning football lol

You fucking pussies lol

Just hold amigo.
Revenge trading and greed
You are welcome
It opened at 228 so probably not much.
Where do you get 80% margins? I see they lost $500mn last year. If they do 80% that's great news, just haven't seen that
so what are next steps on stim?
No government faces repercussions unless it's ruling a third-world country.

Going to laugh so hard if BABA somehow rips for 35 minutes to green.
libertarians who voted on Nov 3 will move to the Repubs probably. I don't think either Dem wins in the runoff.
Fuck it I‚Äôm doubling down on my BABA puts
I‚Äôm telling you all because we‚Äôre in it together. Don‚Äôt be scared, and by leap calls for BABA. Or at least a few months out. It might go down a little more, no one knows. I highly doubt it‚Äôs going below $200. Now is a good time. Print money with me. Ignore the ‚Äúsmart‚Äù kids that don‚Äôt belong in WSB and belong in r/investing. We‚Äôre here for high risk high rewards, that is the WSB way. üöÄ

STONKZ
Lol you are clearly delusional if you think Authoritarian means communism.  China abandoned communism when Deng Xiaoping took power in the late 1970s. They have private property, competitive markets, a central government, and other characteristics that are incompatible with communism. They are a one-party state-capitalist nation, not a communist one.  Does everyone here have any idea of their history?  Since when do you have private property in communism lol

Yeah. But quite a strong one. Doesn‚Äôt go down much
Sell every BABA rip from here on out. CCP cares more about party control than "capitalism"
NVDA huge dark pool prints yesterday if anyone follows flow algo, with textbokm consolidation for a month (1% movement). Today might be a good entry. Buying half my March and June calls now and half end of day.  Afterwards I'll look for a catalyst because it's over due for a big rally.
I wouldn't think so. Unless you mean puts. Fact is the ccp has it out for Ma and they are going to dismantle him.
#BABA rally!!!
Just die so I can buy back in again TSLA
Buy BABA dip! The news will come out over the long weekend that it was just a lil warning and Jack Ma will bow to his commie overlords and be a good CEO so he doesn‚Äôt get sent to the gulag.
Told you guys BABA 0 DTE 220c was the play
Megamind lookin ass
Yeah I didn‚Äôt check lol. Puts on my IQ
Amazon December web traffic up 712% yoy- post xmas jump finna be huge

It really pisses me off how so many SQ card readers seem to default to a tip option even for transactions that never required a tip before. That has nothing to do with me buying 0dte at the top this morning.
Was watching BABA all morning and didn't manage to get spreads filled at the lowest dip. Ah you can't always time these things.

BABA you got this, Jack Ma, you‚Äôre my boy!!

Employees and the CEO will be allowed to sell shares on the 31st. They are prevented from selling due to SEC ipo rules.
Im holding july 25/30call spreads. Shit was like $100.  Super cheap and i think pretty likely to hit considering this holiday season has been all online
So I guess BB isn't popping off past 7.50 afterall
NVDA has been so garbage last 3 months. What's up with it?
wish someone did this for me 3 days ago
Maybe June 280‚Äôs are the better play.....
Drill baba you bitch
Hold the gme line at 20
At least Intel is green lol
The government should have let GM fail, like they let the shareholders fail. Why should GM the company be bailed out for its incompetence? Who loses? The consumers still need cars, they will buy from Ford, and other companies instead, GMs assets would be auctioned off, and the workers would seek out new opportunities at Ford, or other car companies, or maybe in a different industry.  They shouldn‚Äôt have passed the cares act either, the government had no right to shut down business for ‚Äú14 days,‚Äù so I mean you‚Äôre saying they had to give people money cause they fucked them over by closing down? I mean yeah I guess but my idea would be not to close down in the first place, and if you keep giving money to the states you‚Äôre incentivizing more lock downs.
Chet
Vince McMahon freaking out gif
I went from rags to riches with BABA
*sAnTa ClAuSe RaLlY*  Shit was murdered by stimulus talks

Rip. Sorry for your puts
Been there.  Old company was based in orange county Ca and our annual meetings were at Balboa Bay Yacht club
STOP THE COUNT!
Yeah, seems like a solid play. I‚Äôm hoping for it to pop and hit 20$ sometime by the jan 20, but who knows.
Pinning SPY at 368 today? Lame. Idc which direction, just go fast
If it breaks 215 there is no support until 200. That‚Äôs about a 25%-30% drop on leaps. It‚Äôs worth waiting to see what happens monday before hopping in.

GME shares if you want to live
BABA will close at least 230
They just diluted shares what, 2 weeks ago? It traded in the $7-10 range until this week. $14 is the top imo until more positive news.
BABA slow bleed down to 180 over the next three weeks.
Buy the damn BABA dip üö® üö® üö®
Jack MA I averaged down show me those brass balls u have let‚Äôs go

And you think it went up 40% in 2 days organically? That's what a short squeeze looks like. Yesterday was it.  The short interest is probably stable from week to week because shorts are going to re enter here.
Made me check....
Believe they have some catalysts coming in the new year. NIO will be fine
Bft pump in 3...2....1.....
my spy puts just went from positive to negative in 1 minute. FUN!

I have GME CSPs @20 on 12/31 and cover calls @25 on 12/31. I wonder which one will hit.
That‚Äôs why they called it PAC12 after dark lmao

Chill out man it‚Äôs up almost 30% this week

Why the fuck are you buying weeklies on ark
Apparently China cares about monopolies? I had no idea, I thought that was kind of the whole thing over there.
Goes red in one day and you think it's RIP? Where is your foresight
GME &gt;&gt;&gt; BABA
i sold 10 dte 25c covered calls yesterday for .75 cents  I couldnt believe what dummy would buy that
BABA ends the day at $230 and my leap will be ITM
it's probably because you're betting against the trend  the trend is why buy the dip works  learn to identify the trend
Crsr has dipped 15% from its week high in two days. Yeah very normal behavior. Talk about fomo before earnings.
You trolling me rn? Or this actually a thing

Brk.B is mooning. Help my 2021 dream come true by making Buffet sell his own stock because it‚Äôs become a meme
Buying opportunity for CRSR and GOEV?
do you not look at SPY and QQQ?
Use 2008 run up as a reference point and hope/dream for something much much bigger, but also understand that it might just run up to the $60s-80s naturally   Either way I‚Äôm jumping ship summer 2021 unless Cohen pulls something out of his ass.  Then I‚Äôll stay longer

This shouldn‚Äôt be the last of the BABA bad news so I guess I‚Äôll wait
for sure, ambitious too.  it's just crazy how many folks actually have success following up their initial attempt.  the pool shrinks considerably the number of people who can do it twice, three times, more
bought more pltr and gme yesterday, i can only afford to eat cup noodles this Christmas

Having an order in below bid and not getting a fill is probably the most frustrating experience known to man
We the consumer should decide who fails, with our purchases. If a company cannot survive off of the consumers purchases, it should not exist.   What you are proposing is that the government picks winners and losers, as opposed to the market picking winners and losers. What you are saying is inherently unfair to smaller business/small people, because the small guy isn't in the room drafting bailout legislation, but big business is. Big business and big government work hand in hand to consolidate each others winnings.
Nothing to degen on today unless I want to bet on middle eastern soccer. Today is a withdrawal symptom kinda day. Might watch uncut gems today to get in the spirit
Yes to 20
Which dip to buy?? ü§î GME,RIOT PACB already have FCEL
Santa is real because BABA was selling for $211 today.
added another 500 GME shares at 19.97 and sold 24c for 1/15 to bring it down closer to 18.5, won't complain if i lose them.  Cohen's $16.02 Dec-18 buy as my guide

MMs unlikely to let 220c scalpers win, just saying
BABA dumping again
F my life been staring at this shit for a freaking month
USA: congress can‚Äôt agree on shit and shutdown looks likely and same goes for stimulus  China: clamping down on big tech, I think it‚Äôs part of a bigger picture so China can look like it gives a shit about global rules/laws but the impact isn‚Äôt great  Europe: Brexit should be good news for the market, but having the world‚Äôs largest economies fucking around is going to put weight this  Oh and many equities  are overpriced as well and there is a massive imbalance with far too many call options outstanding versus the puts in the market so this helps drag shit down as market makers aren‚Äôt worried about fucking themselves on put obligations.
BABA black sheep have you any tendies?
Stop trying to make PLTR happen, it ain't gonna happen.
crap, bought OTM PUT this morning, was about double profit, now its red, lul, anyway it will goona bounce back to the dip, because grow now it is just housekeepers decided to buy "chep" (sheit)

Still trying to make sense of this Tidal rumor
solid play i did something similar
300c BABA 04/21??
Big vote on Monday. Republicans still don‚Äôt want to pay 2k so we gotta hope unemployment and runoffs light a fire under their asses
CRM WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING!?! THE MARKET'S GOING BACK UP, WHY ARE YOU DROPPING BACK DOWN?!?!
"thats right little Jack, before you were born your dad bought the BABA dip"
Took a gamble and bought NKLA puts yesterday even though they already lost 10%. Feel like unless something drastic happens they only got one way to go
I did
I bought on March 16th, I couldn't care less, long future ahead üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
what do you think of the other competitors? one of them was up 10% today due to baba news
Anyone buying FB calls? ü§î
Bought baba calls at 212 but IV was so fucked that I‚Äôm still down lol
Who else is holding everything bags right now
BABA
How low are you on the CNBC totem pole if you are working today while Cramer is off?
Last time ppl bought the dip on BABA it kept drilling. its down $100 in a couple of months
At this point we all should just continually buy puts for the end of the week trading days.
Spy went stairs down elevator up with decent volume
Perfect going into the tax deadline
Prepare for liftoff üöÄ
Coz I bought calls. Sorry
Yes I understand. IV isn‚Äôt bad but no volume on my strike. Hoping it picks up on Monday.
what could go wrong with having a portfolio where every investment is one in disruptive tech/products... plus long OTM calls? hmm maybe time to get spy puts
I mean, what would you consider success? Maybe he doesn‚Äôt bring GME to a 40bn market cap, but he could at least double it just by refocusing their business. Once we start seeing deals being made (I‚Äôm thinking something similar to Xbox Gamepass) we‚Äôll have a better idea of his plans. But he is ambitious for sure, you have to respect it.
Pretty much all my stocks are red today, yay
Trump must have called Loeffler and Perdue and said he'll sign the bill
oh shiet BABA on sale
Bought in at $11 and haven‚Äôt sold yet thankfully. My $15 5/21 calls are up like 2500%
why did i go in again?
[removed]
DKNG plz
Sigh.. trump pls stop fucking NIO up
Imagine imagining using your imagination.  SPY $400c 1/15/21
Cathie Wood buying $BABA today?
jack ma looks like a human lego figure
All my NIO gains wiped in 2 days
The truest retard statement on this sub
&gt; yee-yee ass  This description always makes me lol
I told you BABA won‚Äôt go pass 200 today
Makes sense YouTube is a red logo
BABA preparing for lift off
Been playing CRM for a while, it has always done that. It follows the dips but doesn‚Äôt recover. Finally dropped it yesterday
ORI shares are literally free money next week.  https://finance.yahoo.com/news/old-republic-declares-special-one-164900146.html
ARKF and ARKW getting ready for a Mars mission.
CNBC coverage today is wild -  *I will venmo you six pinecones for one fake duck*
BABABACK??
I bought 5x 525c expiring in March. $20k in. Good idea?
If you are selling today you are gay
I need baba at 230 in 10 minutes so I can sell before my break ends
I‚Äôm holding... at least for now.
God I'm such a clown I can't pick a winner anymore, fucking bought fastly at the top today
I think I'm gonna go buy one here in a couple minutes.
CRSR, who hurt you?
How big of a hit?

BABA getting a bid from some [HFT and block buying](https://twitter.com/HFTAlert/status/1342153090284150784)
im up 20% on my 225c for next week  did you buy the ask on accident?
Can go to 20 before February good buy in right now
game sucks
Elevator down soon, probably to the parking garage too
It bounced right off my enter key with I was hovering puts
At least my FTEC shares still love me.
Hold your Tesla shares boy and gals Tesla truck coming soon!
Did you mean get out out now? Their ccp antitrust lawsuit hasn't even started.
Amazing that I could've skipped 700 moves this year and just bought SQ and CRWD and been dramatically richer
Seriously. the demographic of that area is very EBT focused...  The announcer sounded kinda nervous lol   I'm sad because I went to buy gift cards for xmas
Woof BABA, what a day. Sold my puts early at 100% profit, but if I'd held on to midday, my contacts clocked in at over 500% profit at some points. No matter, profit is profit!
I made some mostly due to stic. Most stocks seem to be down today. Mostly holding GME and ARK funds
Bois we have a üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåàüêª
You could do that, or my preference is to roll to a longer dated call at a higher strike. So farther out than 7/16
Same

Been red all day

Lol ?Genius??
Better than ISIS reject looking ass Jack Dorsey

Hells yeah.
GME if you want risky big gains in the next 3 months, NIO if you want safer gains but over a one year period.
aapl terrified of closing above 132
Feb 12 2021.
Yes when the game is over at 10pm it‚Äôs already like 1-2am on the east coast lmao
Why did NIO die today
yugh that movie is so skuzzy
‚ÄúAlright guys we need to pass a COVID relief bill. We can probably fit everything on like 15-20 pages right?‚Äù  ‚ÄúHmm, maybe. But what if instead we made it six thousand pages and put a bunch of weird shit into it?‚Äù
Any good credit spreads to set up over weekend ?
How much money did you actually spend on [gamestop.com](https://gamestop.com) the last few weeks?
Pinduoduo? Hmmm, since they're already up over 10% today I'd probably stay away. However, if you're buying the BABA dip, then if more bad news comes out, Pinduoduo might be a good hedge.
Baba loading thrusters
Apple warming up üîãüîãüîã
Big IMO. A good one.  They have a great business model and have prototypes that have already been crash tested, are driveable, etc. as well as contracts with UPS and Hyundai.  US based as well

So we buying baba or waiting for it to keep dropping?
Damn 400% left on the table.  BIG OLE L FOR YOU
Think I‚Äôll buy into PERI dip
Wtf pltr
Monday. Most likely Trump will sign so the economy and government literally doesn't go into the shitter, but there's still the possibility of him leaving it on the oval desk to die.
Can I get some opinions on Visa calls
This shit volume. Just profit taking and then everyone eats the leftover Christmas dip after the weekend.
Buy baba.
EOD rocket coming for bear asshoe

How can I be happy if I can't watch the lines move.
Do I get into RMG now or nah?
I‚Äôm down 20% on ABNB 2/19 115p rn  Should I sell EOD or eat the holidays and see what happens next week?
It went up +70%, what do you expect another +50% lol
Can confirm. Sold too soon, got fucked.
Cramer RT my comment  We in there
I have my last 6k here. What is the lowest risk highest reward play for me? Can not lose it. Im thinking arkg February calls on the dip?
MAKE IT STOP  LET IT END  3 HOURS PUSHED TO THE LIMIT
antitrust lawsuits work out great don‚Äôt they, ask Zuffa how they went with theirs lol
Big facts. Especially using data, I like this guy. If I wansn't broke, I'd buy you an award!
What happened to that GME DD yesterday about something big happening today?
Thanks for nothing you pos skateboard
Hello Margin, thank you for your call.  I'm sorry to inform you that I'm out of the office with limited access to my phone and email.  Please leave a message and I'll be sure to return your money at my earliest convenience.
Pltr gets a $32 million contract...down 2%
"You can lead a hoe to water, but you can't make 'em think"  \-Kat Williams
the bottom was 210, you missed the boat
Sq and pton made me more money than my other 100 moves
That‚Äôs it?
I'm fearful and you know what they said about fear and greed in the market
RMG up 30% now
what‚Äôs the best way i can waste all my christmas money i‚Äôll get tomorrow
BABA, most likely.
pure FD, godspeed
They bailed out GM, Chrysler and Ford.  You‚Äôre saying they should have let one of those three fail.  That was your proposal, not mine.
What is gods name happened to WNW
No one knew the potential of Microsoft, or any other service like them. AI has been developing for YEARS to the point its useful NOW. but what do i know, i only got a college degree in this area.
thats the risk you take buying pumps
Buy the dip fellas.
Ydm you got this
nio &amp; crm
SQ can‚Äôt even end the day green ü§°
Bruh calls or puts over the long weekend and what stock ??
Actually I was looking at the 17.5 c. It has 3k vol.  Volume is how many contracts gave been sold today.
32 million ain't shit tho
Get up SPY I want cheaper puts for EOD
I bought the dip 5 times in a row. This time it will work.
Wait till Monday, if not then it just wasn‚Äôt quite correct
So many people buying a shit company on hopes it can be turned around. lol.
What the fuck happen with the triangle that retards were talking about for pltr???? Fukin technicals
Damn retards really buy Jordan‚Äôs for 8x the retail price. Been in the wrong business my whole life apparently
Hmm not a bad idea, just keep the train going
Let GME die already üò©
Made so much money off buying calls when JD dips then shoots up immediately
NIO certain gains.    But More long term.
exactly
Contract smaller than expected
It's simple the more money you lose today the less you can lose next week
FB March 270c bid ask is so whack! üòíüòíüòí
I'm sure it will pop back up AH once my 0dte calls I bought an hour ago expire.
RMG vote is Monday last chance boys
I know... All you can do is try to imagine you are a normal person
Today -1%  Last month +25%  LMFAO üòÇüòÇ
Got all three like a good boy
If you listened to her ark invest seminar a week or 2 ago, she was extremly bullish on china stocks for 2021.
Buying or selling? Price target?
GME gonna run next week no cap
BABA calls are the obvious choice, which is why I‚Äôm scared of them üòÇ
Any interesting plays to buy?
nope owning RKT is worse
You seen the airbb dude ?
I‚Äôm saying they should have bailed nobody out. By bailing them out they are picking winners. If they do nothing, the consumers pick who survives via purchases.
It‚Äôs still on, waiting for a clear break
If you can‚Äôt lose it stop gambling dumbass
The app is actually already under review for both app stores. Not sure if they have anyone reviewing during the holidays so I'm not sure the exact timeline on when the app will be here.
Today was the perfect day for shorts to attack GME but it is only down like 2%.  I know they didn‚Äôt give up with that short position. What is their next move?
 Hold the line...12:45 Christmas share pump crew checking in.
Pltr calls 12/31
Lmao
That's the right mindset. Capped my own gains on PLTR puts but it's money
$0 in the past few years
Next moth +25000000%
Yeah thanks.. I didn‚Äôt know how to spell the name haha..   What other competition do they have in NYSE?,   Was watching CNBC they put 4 stocks on the screen but I didn‚Äôt catch the 4th one
They have 125 clients
Tried to average down my 12/31 DKNG 54s today, rip tendies
Nah I just buy real companies
Today‚Äôs been a pretty shit day for me
I mean I'm interested to learn. I just have tried to research the company and the descriptions always sound so vague. I would like to understand it better.
S&amp;p is a big hotel. The parking is in the basement. Let‚Äôs say it has 100 floors. We are probably on floor 94 right now and need to get to floor 70. Obviously not going to the garage because we don‚Äôt need to leave the hotel, but need to go back to 70 because they need to do construction on the upper floors so we can keep going higher. What I‚Äôm trying to say is, well, we need a correction.
Why?
Relying on technicals is dumb.
üíé‚úã

It was sub 10 like a week ago, I've read a few DD's that explain that their Hydrogen batteries aren't exactly feasible but it's been doing really well so who knows
same
The same Cathie Wood who took money out of TSLA in November right before its huge month of gains and put it into BABA right before its earnings crash
Sorry I‚Äôve been helping my parents with shit all morning, but what‚Äôs going on with BABA today?
So we are saying AAPL has been developing an EV ready to sell in 2024 while being fucking profitable all these years? So profitable that nobody even noticed the extreme investments such projects take? It true, this may be the greatest company in the history of companies.
Been in since $11. Holding.

Holy shit! I have like 10 followers on Twitter and one of them is Marcus Lemonis. Why is this guy following me LOL.
Supply and demand, good luck going crazy hitting the check out button
Lol as per usual, you could roll them to next week and hope the stimmy passes Monday and bumps the market up
Not really. You need state of the art bots that cost lots of money or need to be a good programmer to write them yourself for you to cop Jordans that will 8x their retail price.
You will stop hearing about it shortly after it stabilizes at $50
Why is CRSR such a bipolar bitch

I'm looking at 530c March and 550 June.  I'm planning to sell some (not all) on the catalysts and switch to day trade weeklies.  Jensen will guide us to Valhalla.
I know and that‚Äôs what scares me üò¨
The real logistics trade is $UHAL - since I see UPS renting trucks from them for holiday season
Yes, buy the ones i just sold. 32c 12/31
I was told to buy high
They need to cover today because it'll be the 13th day that GME is on the threshold list.   Clearing houses might force them to cover their positions for failing to borrow. Combined with a random positive headline, this could very well lead to a mini short squeeze come Monday, similar to what we saw in October.   In fact, it might be conducive to buy weekly calls for once.
Imagine being cash gang this week and not yoloing into SPAC‚Äôs.
So what we betting 700 TSLA  before 1/1??
Gotcha. My calls are far out so no biggie but just wondering. Thanks man
Gains are gains. I could have made an easy $5k this month but got assigned. Haven‚Äôt lost sleep.
oh man i wouldnt have bought puts on baba
They have so much cash on hand it would be wild if they weren‚Äôt making long shot plays like that
#Santa baby, just slip a üí∞ under the tree for me

That's a dying industry my man. They are only putting 2% of their budgets towards developing renewables. Not something I want to touch long term.
Silver
That's nothing on JKS or DQ over the last few days.
to short more and drive the price down, because nobody actually wants to hold GME long term.
What dip do I buy
‚ÄúYou should close the position if you won‚Äôt take that position now‚Äù  Fuck it, when I opened it it wasn‚Äôt -60%
Can‚Äôt even enjoy my Christmas because of CRSR
Under 11 is a mf steal. With a $10 floor it‚Äôs one of the safest gambles out here IMO.
That's what the institions are deciding, depending on if they want uppies or downies on the day ü§ó
Reminds me of the scene in Indiana Jones where the big dude with the even bigger sword comes out swinging it around in a skillful, complex manner.  IJ looks at him unimpressed, casually lifts his pistol and fires at dude, then walks off.
BABA dip is free money guys. It basically like the FB dip during the spring, expect a V shaped recovery.  Anti-christ Supreme commie leader Winnie the Pooh just dumped America bulls a Christmas gift.
Looks like the Vaccine trial results were "fake". Numerous severe "Reactions" being reported by Healthcare workers.   Puts on 2021.
sir, this is wsb
13 stocks why
Welcome to the WSB holiday party! Feel free to try the dips but the xl dip smells a little fishy to me.
If /u/DEEPFUCKINGVALUE is still in were still in.

Just bought Amzn 5000 leaps. Am I retarded?

Something about ipos and shares. But there‚Äôs no way it stays sub 4 billion market cap when everyone and their mother wants to be a streamer now a days
DoorDash with only about 8% of its average daily volume so far. Roughly 16% of the typical volume if you account for the half trading day.  Very strange
I have put in an order but the bid ask is whack.  Reminder, last 20 minutes left
inshallah
Today is a massacre day. Especially for AAPL. So lucky i got out at that pump. Thinking of re-entering Calls again tho at a cheaper price.
This made me laugh
Whaaaaa?? Do I have a source on this?
Buy calls right now or wait for Monday?  April ICLN
RMG‚Äôs been taking off üöÄ
 I did. Then I did again. Then again. :}
Trust in Cathy she knows what she‚Äôs doing üöÄüöÄüöÄ
But that is not what you said.  The problem here is you‚Äôre basing an argument based on absence of facts.  Regardless, if you really think they shouldn‚Äôt interfere in any business then you‚Äôre asserting they should remove all tax credits and small business incentives.  Let the consumers decide right?  You can‚Äôt have it both ways.
It‚Äôs kind of true but don‚Äôt say that :/ there are smart black investors too, I wish as a people they become more educated and level up in love also.

$BABA segment coming up on CNBC - FYI since half of you degens trade that CCP shit
You, like the congress people who represent you, can easily name Ford Chrysler and GM, but what about the thousands of business you can‚Äôt name, that aren‚Äôt big enough for congress people to care about because they don‚Äôt donate millions to their campaigns. Where do their tax dollars go? To bailout a company, while their own company fails? It‚Äôs insanity. Nobody is deserving of a bailout. Especially not big business.

PLTR DD recap (Serious) for those who missed it! (Gay mods removed first post...)  Hi guys first off I'll keep it fast and simple cause some are retards some autistic.   Since Cramer recognizes WSB, we have as much to say as Credit Gay and Shitron. WSB analyst ANAL KING price target for PLTR 42$+ for 2021. This is not financial advice, do your own DD. This is for autism purposes only. Invest at your own risk.  This is a former DD post from u/Felsommer so all credit to him! :  https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/keu3ca/pltr_will_moon_soon_i_got_proof/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share  Next the 1H must watch video on PLTR :  https://youtu.be/_0i9XU3MA7s  And a last one Alex Karp saying PLTR will be the most important software company in the world :  https://youtu.be/6loNXj3LSaw  Now I could add way more, like all the clients they already have etc...etc... so also do some research!  TLDR - All in PLTR
Ur all bark no bite

Hello Darkness my old friend

Fuck no
Manipulated to expire low. Will take off esp in January
updated with link.
Buy the dip. Just reenter at 36.30 x 1200 shares.
funny that some of y'all are freakin out about GME being down 2.5% after being up &gt;33% on the week but in reality i'm super bullish seeing it hold $20, very excited to see whats in store for next week.
It's going to rocket all the way to +3% YTD.  Seriously,  look at the ytd return.   Shit stonk
AAPL is literally green what
Buy the dip. Even if you can call this the dip.
Damn I originally thought this said from touching nba. I was gonna tell you to fade the clippers tomorrow

I need a Christmas miracle
You guys loading up on anything shares wise before the weekend?
Probably quite low. Cathie said they'll expect something like 20+% from the next year.
Lol do it
I hope during the last month of his presidency uncle Donny just starts firing off random stock tickers with an emoji just to completely shake up the market. GME üëÄ TSLA üêê AMZN ü§Æ

That's what the dude who did triangles. He said it will gonna take off this week
That is literally what I said. The government shouldn‚Äôt pick winners and losers. The consumer should via purchases. As far as tax credits, like I said previously, the tax rates are to fund a budget of 1.5T+ per year. I would want the government operating on 500b or less. And yeah, you can remove all tax incentives after cutting the amount of tax you need to collect into a third of what it currently is. Why would the government need to maintain the same tax revenue if I‚Äôm proposing they do absolutely nothing to interfere in the market? They obviously wouldn‚Äôt.
Baby rocketing to 230 end of day
why'd you buy into baba? Or buy AMD weeklies, you'd be better off buying amd 2022 calls

Averaged a little on Baba at $213
CLOSE THE DOOR, STOP THE COUNT, TURN THE FUCKIN SHIT OFF
i've been hovering pretty much around -0.5% on the day with one spike down at open and one huge spike up immediately after before settling at this boring level. i guess arbitrarily a win will be closing green, a lose will be closing lower than -1.0%
Pump you lousy bitch
well.. they're from Ohio
I hate this market so fucking much. It's literally designed to steal my money no matter what I do.
No I bought the exact middle price. The Vega on it is $38 which Is wild. Probably should have made note of that first.
What is a ticker\\gang you learned not to fuck around with in 2020?  I'll go first: TNKR.
Fucking BABA, what a scam. Everything in china is a scam
Why is everyone complaining? These cheap prices ARE the Christmas gift.
Exactly, was just cash I wasn‚Äôt using so we‚Äôll see where it takes us
Fuck your pump and dump just buy spy bro

Don‚Äôt gamble bro. Make your own decision and be confident in it.
You couldn‚Äôt even name Chrysler or Ford.   You‚Äôre all suggesting small businesses do not receive any help at all (see PPP).  Anecdotally I know a lot of small businesses that took advantage of it, and that‚Äôs fine.  I‚Äôm not the one who has an issue with that.
Damn, that makes me sad
APPL is still down if you considered yesterday. And honestly if I hadn‚Äôt got out my contracts would have lost 15% of its value easily. But it‚Äôs holding decently well, so I might re-enter

Epic big chungus rally coming next week?

Bot more $PLTR calls here.
Probably vipshop. I don't know much about this one at all tbh- but it could be a real sleeper. Will have to look into this one.
Yep. 1.5 month long bull flag with declining volume. It‚Äôs gonna wreck 2021. I wouldn‚Äôt short it with your money.
Short squeeze may happen, but trying to pick the exact time it will happen is pretty fucking hopeful.  You need to assess your conviction levels on a post like that.
ya right, you wont see 220 ever again

so, drill then flat to close. nice little xmas fuck you
This is the way
seems like a good hedge against a long american recovery
Was thinking of buying a baba put but realized that time was last week latest. Bought 2/19 210c. Worse case scenario it crashes into a Ma Bell situation but unlikely.

Any CBD recommendations?
This is why giving finance advice is hell. If it goes down they blame you, if it goes up they want more. And I'm pretty guilty of this as well
MSFT keeping me alive today
You'll see
What ever happened to the brexit deal? Thought that was today...?
last 10 min pump lets go
Totally agreed.  Holding $20 when the last time it had a run up it didn't hold $17ish.  Sentiment on the ticker has gone up, plenty of catalysts upcoming, and people are still FOMOing in and out.  What anyone does with their money is up to them, but I'm about them shares and long calls.
Bruh it‚Äôs cool off, over sold rn

there's always a bull market somewhere
bleeding
8 minutes to buy your FDs! I‚Äôm selling $AAPL calls and $TNA puts! Hot ‚Äòn‚Äô Ready!
Ok? I do have an issue with it, the money disproportionately goes to larger companies because larger companies qualified for larger loans. Instead of taxing people and giving their money away to someone else, let people keep more of their money, which they can choose to spend wherever they want. Which is allowing CONSUMERS to decide winners and losers, as opposed to letting the government decide winners and losers by choosing who gets how much bailout money.
i didnt realise plastic was going anywhere. lol  they are bouncing back and will adapt to be clean energy businesses
Got in @ $255 got a long way to go for me GUH
Baba
im thinkin of gettin in but seeing all these bagholders sellin so quickly and sharply cause pooh and the gang are investigating makes me xtra cautious
Bought them ofc yesterday lmfao
I already did in the past with zero success. The last time I bought SPY leaps, we were down -8% in the next 2 weeks and the last time I bought AAPL leaps, it was flat for the next 2 months and I got IV crashed.
All major indexes green.    Pretty much everything I own is bleeding.    ü§£

Oof, portfolio looks pretty shite right now, but I picked up some cheapies today, hopefully we rally monday
Ok maybe AMZN isn‚Äôt the call EOD
I see almost everything as red, bit confused honestly
APPL was pumping nicely at the start then it all went downhill and it literally stays flat when with the huge SPY green dildo like a minute ago bro
Pltr?
Any gains I make go right into more plays until 0. This is the way right ? I don‚Äôt think I have a cash out option
Ffs Idk what I expected. Happens every time I go all in on puts. Next time I want to do that I need to inverse myself but then it‚Äôll probably finally dump
I hate how my sold puts show red on my portfolio, even though they are still above the strike.  I get why, I just don't like it.
It's up from yesterday's open as well, what are you smoking. Up 2% last week overall. Up 13% last month. Excellent performance all around. Would have made money on any AAPL calls other than weeklies, LOL
Well rode BABA Calls up for 20%, I don't have more conviction in BABA than this. Sold em before close.  Let's see how I feel about my paperhands Monday lol.
Are you not aware there's literally a whole culture genre poking at the fact that people jumping off the bridge on Xmas or Xmas Eve due to unfortunate circumstances, usually revolving around finance? No one is telling anyone to jump, just alluding to that. But I see that you clearly didn't get it.
What‚Äôs carrying this EOD rally?
Reminder markets close in 7 minutes
XL $40c here
NVDA should buy Tidal instead of SQ imo. That way they can use their super machine learning to fix the recommendation algos and beat SPOT at their own game.
yeah that makes sense. im thinking about a similar weight for my 401k
If you pussies stopped selling we would be green
pence won‚Äôt do it
Got burned by baba calls so bought shares becuz i am a bitch
Calls on Arkham Asylum
VIX pricing is always bullshit. Lots of space to play tricks. Tried to sell put spread at 400 and sat there unfilled for 2 hours. Then I raised price to 600 and it gets immediately filled. Why would this happen?
Same here, pretty much across the board
It's only money man
You too bitch

Fossil fuels will never be clean energy. And their yearly spending shows that they are still all in on fossil fuels. Plastic production will most likely see a slowdown eventually as well as more countries ban plastic bags and companies cut down on plastic packaging.

Okay I'm gonna mention this stock one more time. PRCH, it was a spac called PTAC that just changed ticker today. This is the next LMND. Screenshot this post and check the price 3 weeks from now. Bet.

Right when I think I‚Äôm out, BABA pulls me back in üò§üò§
BABA calls last chance boys. Will open 240 monday
Up 1k for the day
I like the longer term plays of PLTR - but the option premiums are too high - so I'd look at the stock.
How the fuck can you not buy $BABA? Literally free money!!!! Wtf man we make money here this shit is Amazon ‚ÄúMade In China‚Äù version with their own e-commerce and cloud computing.  EVERYONE PUMP THIS SHIT, WSB HEDGEFUND READY TO TAKE A STAKE ON ALIBABA ($BABA)!!!
Incredible, besides Cohen reshaping the company this Microsoft revenue sharing deal with GameStop is a lot bigger than you think, game stop having the market cap at 1.4billion is just a fraction of what it‚Äôs suppose to be. Twisting that knife into Melvin capital and BofA is so bitter sweet.
Shit man, I don‚Äôt think the pump even happened.    Straight out the gate on Monday it went down.  I mean, we‚Äôre talking Electric vehicle AND skateboard technology.  Together.    The future is now.
Playing long. I'll take some sideways for a bit if necessary.
They do be surviving.
Baba was red for the year earlier today that is hilarious
[deleted]
Just remember. BABA had a record sale few weeks ago on their version of Black Friday.   Their revenue target for 2021 is $106 Billion, which is 49%+ from 2020. Come February earnings, it will be back up. Probably wont breach $300 until they resolve the situation with Xi but their core business is booming amidst this turmoil with the government.
It‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs fault bud
What I‚Äôm saying the point of the government is to help support any and all businesses.  Remember when Donnie started a trade war with China then subsequently had to bail out farmers?  You saying he shouldn‚Äôt have done that either?  Operating a government on 500b or less isn‚Äôt feasible.  Have you looked at the budget lately?  Hell I think the military spends that alone.
PLTR yes, this is a decent consolidation phase and the news flow for them has been exceedingly positive lately  GME no...it's up like fucking 35% in 2 days lol
Nothing lasts forever my friend
Yes
Bought more today
Pharmabro's never lie
Trust in Cathy bro. I bought ARKK today.
RMG gets approved Monday last chance to buy in!
More I fiddle or overthink more I lose, badly. My shitty Roth is up 20% just dartboarding and leaving alone. As for the rest guess I'm claiming losses for a third year now, fuck.

I agree... but there‚Äôs no way BABA should have been down 17% earlier.. any intelligent investor should have realized and bought the dip
low brow content, imo. do you player.

maybe take a quick peep at the last BABA bad CCP news drill sesh  this can go a fair bit lower still
Depends on who is buying
Probably?  There is currently 2 minutes left in the trading day.  It wasn't right.
fuck CRSR, all my homies hate CRSR
When is change
straight cash homie, up a bit from BA bounces this morning.   you have to be insane to hold plays overnight at these levels. only intraday feels safe to me.
Ready for santa rally 100% balls deep in GME, NIO, PLTR, ARKG, and VLDR.
Not a chance. Easier to control it‚Äî put proxy gov agents on the board. I‚Äôm not sure why no one seems to say that it‚Äôs so much easier to take more control than dismantle. They want state champions. They just want to make them STATE-champions.
If Apple goes to $140 its market cap will grow by 150billion which is extremely unlikely.

Bad move, Christmas cheer will continue into Monday, wait til it clears 370 at least
50 big ones? I bet you believe in Santa again.
I'm sure they found ALL the cases. LOL
I wouldn‚Äôt either
Up 25k
If you bought 2 years out, why do you care that it went down 8% in a week? That's nothing. And even with the 2 months IV crush, you got 2 years man. If you bought near the money you should be fine. Give it at least 8 months to a year, or be down &gt;50% before giving up on it!
Faith
Have already lost 3k trying to do this. You can give it a go but be warned that volume has been very low. Very easy for MM to pump only a couple thousand shares to keep price higher than strike price.
Power 5 minutes
I swear PLTR is just staying pinned under 30 until all options expire worthless. MM are fuk
How cool is this pump knowing good and well that bill isn‚Äôt getting passed today and likely getting vetoed before Monday. ü§°
This Christmas I wish Santa rims RH‚Äôs asshole sooo hard so it stops with the 1d old news that keep coming back

3750?
DKNG seems especially sensitive to sell barriers and it sometimes takes a couple days to run back up.  Think people are missing out on the run through Feb though.

Losing $100 makes you hard?
Let‚Äôs go mvis
Bought 275 shares today. Lets see what happens.

Well that was fucking brutal
Yep
doubled down on the dip for my calls
Lmfao Xpeng at 42 really?? This market is so over dramatic I love it. Guess that‚Äôs the free money play then right now. Calls and DCA it is thank you paper hands
Ofc MU pumping at close after I get out
Just clench your butt cheeks, buy TSLA leaps and believe in your messiah Elon Musk
Real men bought the BABA dip , gay frogs was playing with penny stocks / GME / PLTR / spacs
I‚Äôm up lol. Bought BABA calls at 217
stock price is too high imo
All I want for christmas is AMD to go back up to $98
STOP THE COUNT
Wont happen. China wants their version of GOOG, AAPL, MSFT in the world stage. The government wants that.   So stop with the fear mongering. Name a single company that Xi‚Äôs government tore apart with BABA‚Äôs size. You can‚Äôt. All they have done is to fuel the growth of mega companies and they will continue to so.  Unless Xi plans on kidnapping Jack Ma and make him disappear, BABA will be BABA
Merry Christmas!    My ass hurts from today! ü•≥üéÖ
Thats it. Spent all my money on the dip.  PLTR, GME, BABA, AI, FUSE, XL  basically the same thing that keeps dragging me down.
PENISES DOWN MERRY CHRISTMAS FUCKERS!!!
Bull gang rise up

cant explain that
MERRY FUCKING CHRISTMAS RETARDS
holy fuck these are some ugly buys  except BABA tho probably
It‚Äôs such a weird feeling to have your trading day end at 8am :/
Same. Cash gang didn‚Äôt last long. YOLO
I understand what you‚Äôre saying, I also care about people and business‚Äô but frankly I‚Äôm not convinced the government is best at that. The government, the way its set up, is always going to give more of the benefits to their donors, and friends, so the small guy will get left out. Better to allow the market decide then the government, more fair, more efficient.  I do remember that, I disagree with those bailouts as well. What is a bailout? They take our taxpayer money and give it to the farmer right, so, why not, we just keep our money, and the farmers charge more for their product, and we pay more.   Because the military is global, operating in multiple wars all over the world at any given time. Ever listen to Eisenhower‚Äôs speech on the military industrial complex? It‚Äôs a good listen.
Took a giant shit after watching BABA today. Puts on my anal health
position or go fuck yourself
Had 2k cash left and used it on baba dont feel great about it
Not even letting it stay over 29.  27-28 just stuck in the mud
...and ARKG
Time to sit under the Xmas tree doing nothing until Monday
Yeah that tax scheme was proposed before and the problem is the tax revenue wouldn‚Äôt cover spending and would result in larger deficit, inflation, or unproductively increase sales tax.  Again you can‚Äôt run a government on 500b or less.
Thank god it closed early, all i saw today was a continuous bleed down in my portfolio
Redistribute some profits to homeless people if you can. I feel so bad for these these bastards, it‚Äôs fucking freezing in the midwest
Yeah fuck today. Have a good weekend y‚Äôall.
EVERYTHING HALTED?!

If you look at PLTR‚Äôs one month chart you can see a giant wedge forming, likely 1-2 weeks of slight downward movement and then we‚Äôre flying.
what about $TAN?
Thank me later guys. Just bought some SQQQ 12/31 17c and VXX 12/31 18c. Ain't no dip coming before new years eve!

Lesson learned.
That end of day green candle is good news for next week hopefully.
Merry Christmas everyone!

I bought calls when it was at 212 and got IV crushed the past 2 hours. I‚Äôm hoping for a 10% rippper tomorrow.
I wait until 12:50 to sell my calls, and then the market fucking pumps immediately after. Are you fucking serious? Fucking market maker cunts fuck you and your fucking bullshit

You too bro
Dear Diary, I lost tons again today.

I don't need to believe because he exsists
Finished today down 4%. Not that bad right
Lmao
Ideally I‚Äôd like it to jump to the mythical 40 before EoY so I can sell for Mr. Taxman

Yup
i was scrambling to make a move before 1 but couldn‚Äôt get it done  reeeeeeeee  alright what‚Äôs a $1k play for monday
FRHC
Well that was fucked
Today was a good day. BLNK rallied when it needed to most
GUH
I had 2 covered calls that have been ITM for a few days. They expire today. The market just closed, but it still shows me with the calls, and I still have the shares. Did I just get super lucky, and they didn't get exercised? I've never been called before.
I think aapl falls to 115 within 3 months.
Anyone else load up on SPY puts before close?
get fukt chit is only going up from here
GOEV
Legal Casino Action with a Kobe-like clutch finish!
Lol they made sure $AAPL closes under 132 for their covered calls. We run on Monday üìàüöÄ
Lost 8k today. What a great way to start Christmas. At least I‚Äôm still up for the week :( not a loss till ya sell right. Fuckin Amazon and nio
I bought some. I don‚Äôt think it will hit that price by 31 but I‚Äôm hoping to scalp a profit.
You have been banned from twitch
A fine day for day trading tbh. Big and fast swings all over the place. There are more strategies than just buy call and hope it goes up
Thank you Santa for the rally, very cool
BABA bag holders will be rewarded Monday
u grow up in a closet?
Have faith?
Should be illegal to be able to sell stonks on Xmas Eve .only buy orders go through
NIO/XPEV, please don‚Äôt fuck this up further. I‚Äôm already 24% down on fucking XPEV... $ROPE
Hey future millionaire
MVIS  OI puts at 6 are almost double the calls for January. Trying to push the price down. Load the fuck up on the cheap. This company has great things going for it.
I paused day trading today when I saw where things were headed.   I‚Äôm in rough shape but hopefully next week gives me some gains.  Decided to üôåüíé and hold. Hoping GME isn‚Äôt a bust.   https://imgur.com/a/HgPTD82
PLTR back on it's way to $25 before üöÄ to $28 and then back down to $25...  This is the Circle of Life
Yes retard. The market ‚ÄúHALTED‚Äù.

Ass chowder
Cant wait will we can say good bye to 2020. Good lord, this was a shitty year all around
That isn‚Äôt true. Cut social security, cut welfare, cut Medicare, Medicaid, cut the EPA, the FDA, military spending on defense only, and were a lot closer to 500b then you think.
Merry christmas everybody.
It‚Äôs been a good year for me: https://i.redd.it/g9gf3qnoc6761.jpg  XLK, TAN, ICLN were my biggest gainers, took $25k off and transferred to my savings
Merry Christmas all, see you Monday.
i meant this exact moment after early close lol
Down 3k üòÄ
keep 0DTE ITM if you must at least.  Tbh 0DTE is fucking pointless, you should have enough BP kicking around to at least day trade the next Friday's expiries
Merry Christmas you retards!  I gotta go return some presents.
2k stimmy talks **not** going well :(
Yeah I am jacked to the tits right now, same strike and expiry  40x $95c 1/15 as well  If I die, I die.

You will get exercised by Sunday, it's not instant haha

He‚Äôs talking about people from Twitter today
Predictions for 12/31?
542 shares in GME. Whose got me beat?
congrats and fuck you
i'd be more comfortable with 240 as a lotto, but I don't see it dropping more on no news either so üóø
Took an -8.87% ass pounding today üò©
The one who said the christmas run will be a green one and full of tendies.. show yourself
Little
Why do you guys buy end of day? What's the advantage?
wait. there is still extended hours on christmas eve?
Stop shilling that garbage
Yea I got cocky after a solid week. Not worth it.
PLTR is my most bullish position. But we ain‚Äôt seeing anything over 30 until at least January 1st.
X
But im not done trading :(
Merry Christmas or Happy Holidays? Which one is politically correct?
ü§°&gt;üéÖ
Lol I ended up +22.44
We both can agree there.  The government is terrible at managing budgets.  And yes the small guys get the shaft vs corporations.  Which is completely shi tty.  Ideally they would increase funds and incentives to small businesses over corporations but lobbying ensures they always get the fatter part of the pork spending.
Retards are attacking Cramer? Smh kids today
Ah damn
Ladies and gentleman, the casino is closed for today. Please cash in your chips in orderly fashion.  If you have lost money and you owe money to the house, you will be escorted by casino‚Äôs security staff to the room in the back. Merry Christmas

#Don‚Äôt forget to eat your green bean casserole

Wtf market closed already
When it‚Äôs down like this it‚Äôs a discount dawg
Holy shit I thought the market closed @ 2pm and now I am for sure FUCKED.
Lol
Im down 30k lolololol
damn your timing is on point
Awwww shit.  Spy is really about to hit 380 on Monday on stimmy hopes isn't it...
Merry Christmas you filthy fuckin animals
They already do that. Raise taxes and close the loop holes. Where are they going to go? Europe, where the EU is going after them?   They want the protections of being US companies and operating in our legal system, they should pay their fair share.
Next year will be far worse
Anyone here in Mvis calls?
Yeah
[deleted]
Watch metals fly now that you cant buy any calls
If we count my calls I got you beat lol
They‚Äôll exercise if they are itm by a penny. It‚Äôs not instantaneous

It all gets better from here bro trust me I diamond handed because I know this game. January is going to be an insane bullrun for these stocks.

Same reason they buy and sell at open. To gamble, obviously
Lol I know man. Sorry :\
Fuck me for buying these shit calls on shit stocks.   https://imgur.com/a/FWlBnJN

LET ME INNNN!!!

Alright raise your hand if you yolo‚Äôd on BABA
lol did you buy FDs?
Yeah I don‚Äôt mind holding this long term but the share lockout ending in February has me wanting to take profits. But I got in at 14, so might not be worth it
Portfolio is full of spy puts! The end times come next week
Is Cramer on tonight?
Less for Uncle Scam, winning
Who bought puts at BABA LOD?  Me.  Fml
Okay you dummies, I've had a hell of a month with SPACs and I just spent some profits on 200 shares of GME and 200 shares of PLTR.  You've been posting about this bullshit nonstop for a month, at least make me some fucking Money while I'm scrolling past the wall of posts üôè
Irs okay homie you made profit, now if you wanna get back in sell cash secured puts at your cost basis. Thetagang calls this the wheel.
Everyone shows themselves
What‚Äôs a 10 dollar percentage
The only reason I am up today is because of SIRJACKALOT. Free him üò°üò°üöÄ

man nothings moving now, what a boring day
Today I went long on Ford and Honda, short on Intel. How do you guys think my plays will turn out? Missed the morning opportunity for gold calls sadly.
Greedy fkin mms pinning pltr below 28
How!? Baba??
Merry Christmas

GME at literally 2020, very legal, very cool.  Thanks for this year my, dudes. Won some, lost all of it and now clawing my way back.  Stay cool ‚úå
Now holding significant positions in GME, ATVI, GOOGL,BABA
no
Merry Christmas guys
Been freed apparently
BABA gonna end this thread of it slides to sub 200!!!!!!!
No
It‚Äôs one of the retards here moving to Twitter since Cramer ‚Äútold‚Äù everyone to buy BaBa at $260. Always inverse Cramer.
And that will never change. Which is why we should give them less money. This is where we disagree, you believe the government can be fixed, I believe it is more or less impossible for one person to spend another persons money efficiently, which is essentially what the government does. Nobody spends my money better then me, nobody spends your money better then you.
Heads up boys.   Santa has something big in the works for us...
Buy high sell low
Yeah... I thought it was gonna move up more, but learned my lesson. Never traded a Christmas week before. At least lots of my index funds will help make up for a loss within the year if I have to take one.
It's about to be a long boring weekend
For holding the line and going down 13%, we'll be reward with up 2% on Monday :D
SQ burying itself into the ground while all the major indices fly. Of course I bought calls at the top
i think he got unbanned

Not bad, double the losses in half the time
Well, fuck this day.  See you autists Monday AM.  Happy December Holidays
No stimmy. Y market no crash
Today was a good day to buy into pltr. I would have bought more if I wasn't already 150k deep
So excited to see what happens during Christmas and on Monday! Merry Christmas y'all!

When will Cramer be able to pump GOEV then?

Meee
Idealistically yeah.  I remember when Clinton started cutting down on military bases.  People had a shit fit.  Only one in recent memory to have a budget that was projected to be balanced.  If we got closer back to that then yeah it may be more practical.  But how you do start cutting Medicare and the rest?

AAPL 141 12/31
What app is that? PLTR put was nice.
Imagine if markets were just open for 10 mins a day. The volatility would be insane. You'll have a chance to get rich or go broke every trading day.
TSLA mooning next week. Stimmy talks failing brings $ back to GROWTH STONKS
where is the promised gme short squeeze?
 If I lose you win. But yours are 100% more likely. I own like 350 stocks tho, so any gain is great for me.
How we feeling about our QQQJ calls?
Lol, forgot I was in central time again and missed the close. Merry Christmas you dumbasses
Usually there‚Äôs a big move end of day. If it moves against the direction you want to trade, you can get in at a good price.
Just hold man those are not bad plays
And here I thought BABA was my safest holdings ü§°
Covid 20 and probably another v2 virus pandemic is bullish for stocks.
Well.... I‚Äôm finally positive YTD. And I‚Äôm only down 60% all time. Honestly, it feels pretty good to be digging my way out.
gaaay
Theta gang, we had a good week
I thought they were doing a second bill just for stimulus checks?
Half day for Christmas eve.
Bought baba at 220
I‚Äôm going to stick to that rule next time I‚Äôm up to it. Conversely I did manage to buy SE 1/15 calls on big discount (which was one of my trades) so maybe I‚Äôll make some of it back
Reeeeeeeeecap of today's market driving news:  * After POTUS' surprise backlash against the stimulus bill, rightly making fun of the bigly lame $600 check - House Dems moved quickly to try and pass the $2,000 amount they've been trying to secure now that POTUS has made a very public statement on it. McTurtle, now put into a no-win situation has been trying to weasel out of it by political manuevering. GOP and House GOP is now pointing to foreign spending cut as a means to push back and "secure" the $2,000 amount to Americans. House Dems are moving to another vote on Monday now that today's vote was blocked by House GOP. Meanwhile, as the bill stays stalled on POTUS's desk, the likelihood of a govt shutdown and lapse in UI payments for the 12 million unemployed Americans increases. Good times all around! * China, after making various antitrust statement in the past months has finally made good on their threat as they launch an antitrust probe on BABA. Shares of BABA drilled 9% in HK market and was down as much as 17% in US market during intraday low to $211. It'll be interesting to see if this will have actual material impact for BABA once the dust settles, but given how they blocked Ant's IPO, something is likely to come out of this instead of some unknown internal political posturing. BABA closed down -13.34% to $222. Shares of rival PDD is up big on the news, closing the day out up almost 9% to $152.75, while JD is down slightly -1.10% to $84.49. * In WSB meme stock land, GME closed with red day, pulling back slightly to end the day at -2.04% to close at $20.15. RIP to all those that went all-in on $21c and $22c FDs this week and didn't take gains. MT continues to trade fairly flat as its a long-play, once again, don't buy weeklies you dumb fuck. PLTR also close out red for the day, down -3.28% back to the cursed $27 range to close at $27.75. TSLA was able to close out its first week of S&amp;P trading on a green day, though its down overall for the week. TSLA closed up 2.44% at $661.77 after reversing from a fairly red opening yesterday morning. * The market edged out a green day yet again, with Dow up 0.2%, S&amp;P up 0.4%, and Nasdaq up 0.3%. It's Christmas Eve and the market has closed early, so if you're still hoping to get out of your 0dte FDs then you've done fucked up. Market closes tomorrow on Christmas day and no doubt the 3 day weekend will force WSB to yet again have an existential crisis as they wonder what they've been doing all year long and why haven't they become a TSLA/GME/insert-ticker-that-hasn't-sucked millionaire yet.  (Yesterday's recap: none, because I was lazy)
SSPK boys don't miss out. It's weed and technology.
I have a lot of room, GME buys at $3 made my account near half mill. ATVI buys were at $75. GOOGL at $1600 and today with BABA
Lol. Who here expired worthless today?
China fucked me good today but the NIO leaps I picked up on sale will be my revenge

Yup, all sorts of good things coming for semiconductors next year. I‚Äôm in MU and ENPH now, really hoping for a good breakout.

Interesting. Also running some theta gang shit.                           -2 1/15 30c -2 1/22 31.5c +2 1/08 30c                               Semi working. Basically just making money back from my calls with theta. I guess I like running @ break even.
I still need to look more into that. Seen a couple posts about it
Thanks, both my parents died on Christmas when I was 12
You can't trade options after hours lol
You bought in GME at $3??  You are either an absolute visionary or whatever the opposite of that is lol
Quick and short one cuz its a light news day. MM has already took off from their helipad and are busy enjoying the lines off that sexy guy/gal escort's chisel abs/plunky ass.  Might repost this when automod ever gets around to doing the weekend post.

now's a good time to buy tesla shares and sell calls on them. (Or sell put spreads / IC)  tesla is going to be way more stable going forward but there's still relatively high IV as a remnant from before, so cash in on that before the Iv drops.
Portfolio margin :)   I'm sure you can sell puts without being cash covered on tasty with a regular margin account.. look into upgrading your margin account, maybe you missed something

Either way my friend!  Best of wishes works too, and that is my wish from me to you.  Enjoy the break and get those dusty bowls washed and filled with something for Santa.
People would need to be convinced that keeping that extra 10% of their check would benefit themselves and the country more then the government taking it. I don‚Äôt really think it‚Äôs possible, people are really stupid. Milton Friedman died trying lmao.

4 day clear? The fuck you talking about.
It's odd that you think race has anything to do with religion.
When do you guys tend to enter your day trades?
making good plays nice
Palantir is such a dope name for a company
This would be more fun if on up days, someone handed me my profits in cash.
My man, hopefully it catches some volume on Monday
Mvis calls had a part to do with it
does this include baba?
Lmao
**HOW MANIPULATED IS THIS MARKET.. last 20 minutes spy goes from 367 to 369!?? Also I‚Äôm a bull but That isn‚Äôt good news. Long way down when we could have started the climb back to 369 on Monday üôÑ
Because we‚Äôre going to get the $600 stimulus and Trump was just trying to look like a good guy and distract from horrifically corrupt pardons without actually doing anything.
beware of ENPH, price is WAY too high imo. unsustainable
SPACs usually decide their trend in the first week. I bought some shares just in case. Lemonade and Porch Group seem to do entirely different things, but if the housing market lasts, I don't see why this can't double.
Need GME to drop like a rock next week!

I want to bang Sara Eisen
Needs a catalyst. WSB projections were Q1 - Q2 in 2021.   I'll keep holding shares as this shit rises even without squeeze and I kinda want to see GME succeed.  Merry Christmas my dude.
You‚Äôre right.. I did

Jaydon 4 mod
-0.0073 lol
Didn't know today was a half day. Closed a risky position like 30 seconds before closing by coincidence (although a second one is open and will fuck me on Monday)  Marry Xmas you god damn degenerates.
I see. Well I hope we both win. Cheers mate
Positions?
Oh boy
At the high point. I‚Äôve become quite skilled at it.
Unless they changed it it was 4 days before lol
Followed for more updates.  Good shit
At the worst times

Totally.
Have 4 days for CCP and BABA to start making out in front of the camera.
I kinda liked the fireworks screen saver.
Options are fuckin nuts, I watched some baba 215 puts go from $40 to over $500 to worthless by end of day
I bought some 290c, 300c, 305c for BABA at close, I might be the king of retards üòÉüî´
#FUCK BABA, FUCK XI POOH BEAR FAT FUCK, FUCK CHINA AND CCP
You bulls are gonna get what you deserve üêª
Thanks Chimpu
no, the bot just does it at the same time every day
had to move from ARK to BABA
Probably missed something, thanks for replying tho and congrats!
Remind me why I recognize that name?
I exaggerate a little but after Burry letter last year I put my full ira of near 20k in GME near $3.70. Then in March-April market collapse I put in 30k new money near under $4, but in April it dropped below $3 and I bought several thousand shares between $2.80-$3.30 on margin
No rocket for you
Yeah the canoe was sinking
Don‚Äôt forget   How can you have any pudding if you don't eat yer meat?
Ditto, but that‚Äôs more of a lotto i got in on Monday since there were rumors of a price target increase which just got published today. So hopefully that‚Äôll provide a short term boost. I‚Äôll take a two-bagger on it if there‚Äôs a chance.
Yesterday was -0.92 at close. Today it did closed higher which resulted in a net gain from the mega pump at the end. I got in after the huge APPL rally day, so the movement after that really fked me. Foolish for me to think it will continue to rally like a meme lol
You‚Äôre fucking insane. BABA is down 30% from its highs. Stocks like BABA don‚Äôt drop too much more than that
How do you retards obtain this much money? It has to be some kind of inheritance
We know we know we know if it doesn‚Äôt your hedge fund is moving it‚Äôs offices to under a freeway overpass
Well.... I trusted you before and look at me now üôÉ but no way but up anymore though.  No point in selling either.
Thanks üòä
Everyone complaining about the dips too...
What more money?
It‚Äôs Lord of Flies right now
Well that‚Äôll be fun losing all that money
fuck you pltr that is all
I like you but you might be the biggest chaser on here  You always have a $50k play going on the prior month's meme stocks
Sold a new batch of FD covered calls and got a few more shares of pltr
Best of wishes to all of you for the Christmas break.  Do something nice for a stranger and keep the Christmas miracle alive.  Easy to say, hard to accept but I assure all of you: Health is wealth!
Dude same thing with my calls, I went from 45% up to 10% up. Is it IV crush?
We tank Monday
Ha thanks. Have a good holiday friend!
Yeah it was my first time playing AAPL. I wound up taking the earnings and swinging BABA. You‚Äôre gonna make a killing when earnings are in

Usually pile their gold horde at tax havens like Ireland or south east asia then issue bonds to pay expenses back at home. America literally has to bend down and suck corporate dick with tax holidays for companies to bring back home cash.
Yeah the problem here is social security and Medicare is a pyramid scheme at this point.  It isn‚Äôt the people paying that would need convinced, it‚Äôs the people receiving which generally makes up the majority of the voting populous.  They do not have the funds to float long enough to stop supporting those dependent on it now.

Deep ITM ARKG calls were on fucking discount.
You don‚Äôt need those. You lost everything
Story isn't baba. Pdd printed fucking bigly off da news
Happy Holidays!
*maybe*, but what do we know about the market?  It's a petulant teenager.. overreacts to everything, and generally takes a little while to realize shit ain't as bad as it thought.
I bought all the dips this week basically, my cost basis is $3 right now because I forgot to sell some when it ripped up past $92 today  I am going to need to start selling some at the rip and re-buying at a lower cost if I can  AMD usually goes up, them comes right back down again. Has been doing this for months...
Its down 33% in 2 monts. More than half of these losses  were in 1 day (today). I would call it darkest. I think,  it's oversold,  and should bounce,  at least in short term
for $600, I bought 155 x IWM 120p expiring 1/22/21. I think mango fucks shit up bigly the next 4 weeks. Y'all need some kind of hedges if you have any long positions.
  Happy Holidays!
Market is running on hope.  In this case the hope something will get cobbled together.  If you believe your thesis just short the market, or buy 3X short SP500 ticker.
Ok big dawg, I see you.
Happy Holidays!

Xi made it his plan to destroy WSB once and for all!!! Coal for Christmas!!
Buy SPACs at NAV and wait, make somewhere between 25% and 1000% profit, sell and repeat.  Makes buying regular stocks seem as risky as options.
Wait markets aren't open Monday are they ?
Hey only like 1/4
What a wack day. VIX went down with major indices basically flat.  That stim vote failing robbed us of multiple 10 baggers but I'm a patient man.  Bought some March and June calls with low volatility.  Tech earning season is coming back.
wish there was panda express in nyc lol
I want to believe you but everyone who has said the market will tank on a Monday was wrong. ATH incoming.

Once upon a time when these positions were a little more mainstream they discussed how they would get rid of social security, basically we could cut a check to every person under the eligible age, for their money they paid into it back. The current old people would be grandfathered in. Moving forward, no more payments. It‚Äôs not perfect but we‚Äôre going to have to take an L at some point, or our social security will expire worthless like the 4/20 180 SPY Puts this sub was holding.
Same but shares. Haha.
Not sure the premium on it (breakeven) but it sounds like a solid play

I rememeber the day enph got the hindenburg hit squad report an fell to $30 / share by the end of the day.   Almost yolo'd my entire 401k / IRA / brokerage account into the stonk...but did not for no good reason.   this run up lately has just been insane. good luck on the position.

Oof. Good luck
After seeing sir jack a lot dumped I am losing my appetite
I‚Äôm in SPACs but to have 150k to yolo on PLTR shares at (I assume) a young age, it seems like that‚Äôs not possible without having at least a giant startup pool
Lost 10k on BABA calls. Merry Christmas to you too Xi
Picked up some mid Jan PLTR 30 calls at the end of the day.
Must be hack
I‚Äôm fucking done. I was waiting for SPY to hit 369 to sell me calls expiring today and it barely touched. Fucking market manipulation
there are plenty in nyc
Gimme positions

I got a pretty good price on my 2/19 300cs even with the iv. Less than $60. It goes up to where it was before I‚Äôll print.

Christmas rally is last 5 days of the year plus first 2 days of new year
man, I bet a lot of people bought BABA weekly puts on Wednesday just based on the charts potentially setting up a drop.
They should have sourced it WSB instead of TSA
Speak EST
Nope
It‚Äôs following snowflake I guess cause they have a huge position in it
It is only bullish under Trump presidency, it‚Äôs actually the worst case scenario under Biden.
...??
[removed]
NIO is gonna pump January whatchu talking bout
earlier her hair and makeup looked like she just got railed
Biden basically said no to cancelling 50k in student loan debt. Despite the fact that it would only cost 1T and literally be a stimulus for middle and low income. This is why I have no doubt the market will continue mooning under status quo Joe. He'll print and pump for the mega rich just like everyone else.
let's get the bread! I have 09/21 $250
Embrace it
Was definitely a stressful ride and admittedly I‚Äôm nervous about BABA. Good luck to you man!
Oh stfu. 99% of the people who are getting their panties in a knot have never even fucking heard of these people before trump pardoned them. Suddenly it‚Äôs a giant issue. Fuck off
Full speed ahead!   I can see a moon over yonder, it‚Äôs dipped beyond the horizon.
Nah like 350 lmao, not enough to truly be upset about but enough to say fuck!
CRSR gonna need to partner with GME to exclusively sell their gaming gear at the newly created cyber cafes / TSLA showrooms
minor setback for a major comeback
Puts it is then
Mainly people thinking, wow, green by EOD.. buy.. then price slows down, oh, never mind, I don't want to pay that much anymore. Also the call holders thinking, maybe I should secure my profits and sell.. supply &gt; demand, price drops.  Or I made that up and it's not how option pricing works at all. This is why I moved away from options for the most part.

Jack Ma anyway looks like someone who fucks his ass with his own fingers without first washing them
What are you talking about no it didnt
year and a half out... 350cs.... literally cant go tits up right
shouldnt the new direct listing thing for new companies be a guh for SPACs without targets
I would not put it past China to say that the anti-trust probe came up with nothing, or slaps just a small fine on BABA. They just wanna fuck with Jack Ma and American investors.
Well I hope GME goes up
Icln leap
Crazy. Thanks for the info bud
I‚Äôm all in on MGNI leaps (and FLueNT, but I can‚Äôt talk about that hear).  But I‚Äôd be looking at UVXY if I was expecting volatility.

BABA closed where it was at last year.  Just gives you another chance,  who missed the rally
Remember that big tech earnings are coming up late January into February.  Pick up low volatility calls or options when the tickers are red.  Don't recommend holding through earnings but you can bet that they'll have a spike before earnings.
You realize future traders will buy anything..... right?

You're right, I *am* insane, but that doesn't make my guess *wrong*.  What caused it to drop?  News.  What will cause it to go up?  News / sentiment *countering* what cause it to drop.  How likely is that?  50 / 50.  I'm leaning toward people seeing that massive fucking drop when they look at their portfolios, panicking because the market is closed, and selling more on Monday.  However, if "good" news comes out, maybe they buy the dip.  If it doesn't between now and Monday, I'm thinking we see more freak out.  Then we have to take into consideration Asia, Euro, people on holiday and not even looking at their portfolio, etc.       ...what happens if *more* bad news comes out?  It surely ain't gonna make the shit moon.    What are the odds of funds pushing news to push it down further so they can buy more, cheaper?  Pretty fucking high, since that's the kind of shit they do.  Of course, I could be wrong.

BABA leaps seems like such an obvious play that it‚Äôs bound to fail. That being said, in for 11/21 270c

what the fucking fuck, corsair? 2 big down days in a row? No. not okay

I think it will; today was a low-volume day and every move is magnified.  Even if it drops further it'll bounce back eventually -- can't see it going too low in the near future.

Fat chicks need luvin too
If silver would stop being a bitch and hold 26 thatd be dope

Thought so. But I'd take 10k. Better than nothing
i remember back when i was an emotional bitch and i put 9000$ on spy 0DTE to try and scalp and constantly revenge trade.  im glad ive grown. i dont think ive touched a spy 0dte since that day, (3-4 months ago) and I usually dont have that much control. Much better trader because of it, dont day trade boys. By swing trading you increase your chances of profit vs day trading by like 40%

Whenever price drops too quickly toward my buy price, I tend to reconsider. In your case, it straight skipped right past it.

damn BABA got absolutely destroyed today, 13% in a day for a company with 600b market cap...
https://i.imgur.com/ByjpKMV.jpg Look at today‚Äôs volume on BABA on the year chart
One of my best trades of all time was dumping my huge amount of BABA calls last Friday at a 20% loss wew that was gratifying then and it is very gratifying today. Never touching anything chinese again (except NIO you can still get this D üòò)
Honestly I feel like you could pick any China stock this year and win big bucks once Biden in office.
Good. Keep the status quo
Yeah i dont see a Ma Bell splitup scenario. Baba is too intertwined in their economy and quite frankly their most successful domestic company ever. Heck how many citizens and Committee members own Baba?  Its like owning Apple. Everyone owns Apple. National pride that drove them to try to build their own airliner means they aint gonna shoot the Nio, Baba goose. Tighten the collar aye until jack ma toes the Party line.

Gotta report those losses

TSLA saves my ass every time
Depends, is he dehydrated?
I think we get it, you are overexposed to pltr, you are scared and you have realized you have made a bad decision, it‚Äôs still a pump and dump. No amount of shilling will change that. You will lose a fuck load of money.
dude I'd let him pee on me for a share and will come back every day for more
I dont know. That dude‚Äôs head is not proportioned right. Big head, big forehead, small hair on top
Anyone who thought that was going to happen is hilariously uninformed.   Biden is the guy responsible for making it so that student loans are not part of bankruptcy protection...which was paid through his son who was sitting on a legal board at the time. There was controversy about the payment at the time...long history of going through Hunter to pay off daddy.    RIP toeveryone gambling with student loan payments üòÜ
That volume, though.  If you sell them at market order - you will rank it back to April's level, lmao
Imagine thinking China is more powerful than the USA üòÇ they are some dumb fuckers. See $LK and $BABA
I gotten set rules for 2021. How on earth have I lost in 2020 is only my retardness and paper hands fault.   So:  1. No shorts, no puts  2. No options 3. Shares only  4. If leveraged x5 is Max  And hoooooold.   Fuck me. First thing on monday I'll do is probably YOLO in some stupid shit and paper hand once it drops a little.   I still got 13k from my 21k trading account in. Any ideas for a 2021 comeback? Gotta make at least 8k...
Yeah buddy! Same sauce. We can get matching yachts and name them, more theta 2 and 3

according to zero research and just based on a few tweets i've seen that may or may not be true, historically S&amp;P growth is greatest under a dem president and split congress, but also the difference is just a few percentage points no matter which way it's sliced and the only logical conclusion one can reach is stonks only go up

Im trying to help you but have fun losing money.
That‚Äôs how bureaucracy works. You put in 900B and end up giving $600 to consumers... when 600x300M is only 180b. So we could have sent out checks 5... 6 times as big? This happens with literally everything the government does. Including the other 5 trillion they gave out.
Crumpet hands
Should have had some TSLA calls
Maybe BABA. It was at 300 a couple months ago, down to 220 now due to regulatory problems. My guess is it will double in the next couple years from 220. Leaps are a decent play here.
Why are they having only Red and Green?   I love corsair because everything is supposed to be full RGB.

so glad most of you made a million dollars this year, thank you so much for the constant daily reminders!!! absolutely nothing changed about my life this year, despite spending every waking minute here.
Idk but I need this because I basically bought the top. Average price of 14 per share. Sigh.
So BABA lost what? 100 billion today? Yikes.
Everyone holding baba trust me you are not fucked at all. Long term this stock is going full on Amazon status. This dip is a blessing and a curse. I don‚Äôt hold baba cuz I knew this was coming but she‚Äôll bounce nice when it happens.
lol... people will still be saying this to me in 10 years, just because of my username.  I don't study with the same intensity anymore, I found that I can make $ just by (generally) following meme pumps, buying contracts 45-65 days out on solid stocks that have been consolidating for a while, and an occasional yolo.  It took a fucking long time, *countless* books / vids / lectures and a lot of money to figure that shit out.  Simplify and follow the trend.  2021 will be the year.

In order to defeat China, the US and India should combine to become one country. Would be so badass

Leaps? Like ARKG leaps or just straight up ARKG /ARKK shares...

Well this sucks. Merry f‚Äôing Christmas
if you knew, should have bought puts

As a board member,  you should suggest them to start making ev, or solar panels. Put it up for vote

I picked up RH on a whim because I wanted to trade options and I know they approve anyone. Next year I might check out TOS or WeBull
I have 3 brokers, RH, Webull, and TOS.   RH for small options play where I don't want to pay $1 for each contract. Webull for super early premarket trades (it opens at 4am EST) and also has free options but I hate their UI, and TOS as my main account since it's the most advanced. If TOS had free options and earlier premarket hours, I'd shut down my RH and Webull account.
It was for whoever sold you those calls.
This was excellent. I really understand this concept now. Thank you.
LMAO

Is anyone in QELL? It‚Äôs another EV SPAC.  I tried doing a search here and I can‚Äôt find any talk of it. I‚Äôve taken a break here for a bit just getting back. Got that Christmas bonus to blow!

Stop buying BABA, I'm EU and cant buy till monday
360s 1231
Curious to know if ARK bought more BABA today to average down on the shares they bought on Monday.
Why deep in the money? I went deep OTM...
Maybe. I don‚Äôt mess with puts (yet). I wouldn‚Äôt bet against EV/Solar anytime soon with Biden on the way in. I‚Äôd rather play it safe with Leaps on ICLN/TAN. Other safe‚Äôish bets would be CHWY/PTON/CRSP shares/leaps. But that‚Äôs my risk tolerance in my mid 30s. In my 20s, I didn‚Äôt hesitate to drop 6 figures on TSLA when shit was still on the brink of bankruptcy every earnings report.
It will
Was down -$50k today but managed to do some high IQ dip buying and closed at -$65k for the day. Merry Christmas
Depends if you think stimmy passes
Where do you think XL will be come February?
Wait, so did STIC close at $18.50?
Definitely this is insane discount ,I'd maybe wait till Monday tho see if there's another  drop but a rebound is for sure
Only thing we got for xmas is the shaft üëâüçë

hopefully all my 1/15 calls print....
i think they can and do significantly affect the economy, but the upward inertia of the stock market is too strong and in the long run will be pulled or pushed up by any number of factors.  that's why i find it pretty dumb when people talk about presidents having "pro-market policy"
I will stop the world and melt with you
This is a huge dip, obviously it‚Äôs going to get filled seeing as how the company isn‚Äôt going to magically disappear. Stonks only go up
So the US gave trillions in bailout money to large corporations who didn't need it https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/business/coronavirus-bailout-spending/, but can't afford remove student loan debt which is only 1.6 trillion? literally not even sweat for the fed, fuck the corrupt ass leaders of this country
I say there‚Äôs a 42% chance that we‚Äôre getting 2k come Monday and maybe a 74% chance they ‚Äúcompromise‚Äù and make it 1200 again
The problem with sending Mitch McConnell to the guillotine would be that no one can tell where his face ends and his neck begins.
Find out what the company actually does before calling it a pump and dump

Don‚Äôt lie to him that‚Äôs not very nice of you on Christmas Eve
People wonder why there were protests all summer
Jesus. I‚Äôm feeling like I believe you. You should let us know wtf happened because if they don‚Äôt have a justifiable legal reason for breaching their part of the contract, you have grounds to sue. I‚Äôm not litigious, but there has to be some law against withholding your control over your assets for no reason at all.

I hope Jack Ma truly believes that BABA is being investigated for something of substance, rather than his stupid mouth.
Inshallah
NGL, not winning much money from WSB, but did gain some karma...
I left $90k on the table today with 180 47C BLNK FDs. RIP!
Sometimes I feel, like I am drunk behind the wheel.  A wheel of possibilities, however it may roll.  Give it a spin, see how somehow you can factor in. You know there is more than one way to say exactly what you mean to say
When did takeout become so expensive?  I remember when you could get a fancy meal for $100. Now uber eats from the local hood takeout spot is the same amount.
Xi Jingping will not let BABA fall
Merry Christmas.... what‚Äôs your account balance at in total?
should i buy arkg on margin and then sell ccs to pay off the interest
yo i swear if this were feudal times some of my friends would be the fucking peasant on the farm arguing why our masters deserved all teh monay.  BABA leaps
The answer is they won‚Äôt. Ma will comply and they won‚Äôt destroy their national pride
Today was a giant Christmas present. If you didn‚Äôt buy then what are you even doing?
Oh god! oh fuck!
he‚Äôs the one doing the investigation
On what?
1% is your return.
Please show your perfectly timed calls bought at the very bottom.
Fucking 1%
closing over 20 after doing 60 percent over 7 or 8 sessions.  you tards need to fuckin zoom out.
ARKG struggled to make a comeback today, despite the end of day rally for SPY.   SPY is due for at least a modest correction. It hasn‚Äôt even had a -1% day since **October**. If we see spy correct slightly back to $355, ARKG could deflate substantially back to $88.

Yeah that shit printed
For shares, they definitely make a difference in some situations. I'm down thousands of dollars on a trade because TOS opened 5 mins too late when price was at my breakeven point which I had a sell order at. In that 5 mins, price went back below my sell order and once PM hours started for TOS, price kept dropping. I was asleep the entire time. Woke up and saw price hit my sell but I still had my position, ugh.  But mostly, I use it to buy penny stocks since many of them run right when PM officially opens.
im in july 2022 leaps so i've got time but makes sense if he thinks its gonna fall further

Merry Xmas Eve you filthy animals! Lost 20% of my port today but yall still make me smile!
Lemme get this straight: Canada stimulus pays their people $2k A MONTH?!?  Yo Americans really do get fucked in the ass constantly. The Dude does not abide.   Need some stimmy for options. I mean I guess I don‚Äôt really need a stimulus check. But it would be sweet.
I think it would moon even harder if millions of Americans are suddenly able to save for retirement/pump the shit out of the market

Asking about what‚Äôs the difference in playing STIC vs BARK? One is already there and other one will be listed as new tickr. Do I get the pump with STIC or wait for BARK?
If Mainstream media is covering stink gains, that means there's a risk that everyone is already leveraged up to their eyeballs.  No bueno for January. Flash crash potential high

Look at the haters trying to bring ICLN down.  That‚Äôs a big 0.2%.  Good job Bear gang.    See you in January when we take this to $30.
It‚Äôs an active fund, what it‚Äôs holding now could be completely different in a month
Forreal. There was some bargains today though, CRSR, BABA, NVDA... good day to enter positions
Making a call on MTCH. An almost monopoly in a Industry booming in the late lonely Christmas time. Their next earnings will blow the stock out of the water.

Anyone following spacs shine any light on NGA and QELL?
Calls and a red portfolio
Any other good news you got?
Good for that guy
I Was rejected by McD unfortunately
You are correct
or you could have just short sold GME with all that money yesterday and got an near 10% return instead of 1% playing with a ludicrously hot, overvalued stock. Could have even sold short covered puts with the current IV level and IV crushed some retard super bear
Agreed, and thank you.  That's how I lost a fucking *ton* over this past year.  Total stupidity.  The next dumb shit I moved into was selling half at 100% and waiting for it to go ballistic, when I should have just taken my 100%'ers and been happy.  Most of what I lost this year were those two things.  I was profitable in *so many* positions and either broke even or lost it all.  Total fucking stupidity.  Well, maybe some of it was being naive.  Nah.. stupid.
ARKF is cheap. Its a slower to grow but you can look for 2 percent in 2  months and its guaranteed.
Isn't it wierd that most of these congressmen have MBA's from Harvard, but they still managed to run up a large federal deficit?
CRSP was down too it was just low volume
Only down $5K for the day   Today was a good day
[removed]
That'd be good for my port. I'm just saying to hedge for large January flash crash + volatility.  Do a remind me of this comment for Feb 1 or so.
Why isn't BABA moving anymore?
I have all my IRA and 401k shit in Fidelity, maybe I‚Äôll just go there
can you trade on thinkorswim with a TD account I fucking hate the TD interface
Not in silicon valley though.
See you Monday bb
BABA at 220...   Holy fuck
when articles come out urging you to sell after going sideways for a month. were going fucking higher. not lower. higher.
Well today was awful.
imagine american brand capitalism under yang's UBI  it would be like that meme of the futuristic city
I'm suprised the üåàüêª aren't in full force in this discussion thread rn. They must be off setting the table for their wife and her boyfriend's romantic dinner tonight.
Yes. Calls up 30%. Shares up 6%. I liked what they were buying in that fund
[removed]
Lol 2k a month would be cheaper then infinite corporate welfare
\-7900
This sounds good.   I have 2 broker accounts. One for investing. Which is doing fine. I recovered a lot after Wirecard (had tons of it) but basically this account is my buy and hold account. Shares only.   The second account is my daytrading or yolo account. And there im like 2k up and 4k down, which results in -8k.   I gotta recover it. No pressure, this are not my life savings or so, nothing that will change emy life if i lose it, but damn it sucks.   Especially that 2k win, 4k loss pattern.   One advise I got, I think im gonna follow is - buy indicies CFD x20 on red days and sell on green. 2021 may not be so different from 2020.   It still sucks. Need to clear my head over Xmas, not think too much and fucking go into 2021 to recover bro!
ARKG is weighted like Chad in biotech companies, not virgin loss-exposure like SPY
Shhhhhhhhh
Will baba moon or dump on Friday? I‚Äôm thinking ccp give baba a slap on the wrist

It's an actively managed fund.
So does BABA trade tomorrow in China
Heard that one already a few weeks ago

Coffee break. Happens every day around this time
Don‚Äôt underestimate how Chinese ppl value their brands, people or businesses succeeding on the international stage. It‚Äôs nonsensical they‚Äôd destroy their biggest company and let US get ahead. Unless MA becomes a radical, it‚Äôs all political theater as of now
Yeah I might be a scared paper handed bitch but you won‚Äôt know the shitty feeling of losing half your position overnight! So be careful!!
AMD 92 12/31 calls killed me today üòû

after hours and with a bunch of people buying 1-5 shares, it likely won't move much. Action begins again Monday morning.
Exactly, if nothing changes he might be right but I don't see that happening. I get the daily newsletter from ARK and they add and remove stocks on the daily.
Hahaha
Canadian money isn‚Äôt the world reserve currency so they can devalue their money all they want

I was just being sarcastic :(
Stim got rejected just so we could have have more stim talks going well. Extremely bullish
Looking back it seems to dump mid to late jan.
We get it. You have puts in ARKG. Who are you trying to convince, us or yourself?

Consolidation in the 20s is fantastic
Fuck I‚Äôll get in on it. What‚Äôs your positions
According to Cathie, her G fund will likely be the best performing one next year.

take some hits for me too.. this year has been absolute trash, i would drink and do hits too but cant with family in the same house
He ain‚Äôt wrong
Gotta feed the monkey, man
i'd argue that the pandemic has been *better* for small business that non-pandemic.  all these people who had never heard of small businesses who are now bitching about the government not helping them were never going to shop anywhere besides walmart and amazon anyways, so their customer base hasn't declined, so any stimulus help they get is pure profit. it's unfair really they deserve *less* help
hmm i played stocks only. bought around 80.
Few grand into BABA calls several months out
Did I buy at at he top?  YEP   Did I make some good tendies?  NOPE   Do I have paper hands?  YUP   Is my wife gonna fuck me?  NOPE
Exactly, yet identity politics and idolization are at all time highs...turns out it's quite easy to keep the plebs down.
I mean it's technically takeout with a middle man. I just paid $100 and the uber fees totaled like $8. So it's still $92 for takeout.
There's a conflict between what MS wants in their deal (physical stores) and what he &amp; this new activist firm wants.  I don't get his plan to try and turn gme into a version of steam, but ya maybe it'll work.  Should be volitile stock either way!  Good one to play the ups &amp; downs.  I got 1/15 19.5p, fingers-crossed it dips.  If it hangs out flat a bit might grab a call - if they can oust the CEO or take over a few board spots that should be good for another pump.
Why would the people who bought today be morons? Do you know how many people were holding it at close last night? The people who bought today got a better bargain then most.
Who would have thought CIIC would be the most consistently green stock in my portfolio.
You have both COVID and BABA? Damn, you need like exorcism
UBER eats is a funny transaction where all four involved parties lose money at the same time.  -Uber loses money, no surprises there.   -Drivers lose money after accounting for gas, mileage and everything.   -Restaurants lose money because of huge fees and cuts.  -Customers lose money because of fees and tips.

So glad FUBO is tanking they‚Äôre the reason I missed the bama game
definintely one of those forever poors.  break even selling = winning.
WTF?
If the stimulus passes, Apple is gonna moon. I swear I see Tik toks all the fricken time about how ‚Äúwhy would you buy the Apple headphones, instead you could buy 4 Apple stocks‚Äù. I swear if the 2k stimulus goes through half of the white girls in America ages 18-30 will buy at least one stock of Apple
who cares about 1 company? they can let this drop to $180, strip their market share and spread it across 100 companies, that would be better for brand value

You are a retard.

Lost 17% net value, mostly on a large BABA call collection, and I had to make tough decisions on what to sell in my portfolio to be able to double down on BABA. Twas no fun
Yikes. Man didn‚Äôt realize how precious his time is
They are all broke
# **BUT THE ARMY NEEDS MORE TANKS**
Hey if past performance is any indication, you know how to time a dip right. You‚Äôve got more balls than I do going in today lol but I‚Äôm looking to get back into BABA as well in the new year. Good luck to you too!
Uber actually makes money for basically doing nothing. Drivers earn pennies. Everyone else is sucking a big red dildo

Yes in fact I‚Äôd say ToS is the primary way to trade with TD
NKLA puts are better than sex
Opinions on MVIS? I doubled up today on the dip, smart or stupid play. I got greedy and didn‚Äôt sell 2 days and missed out on some nice tendies.
Nice confirmation bias
Would be pretty messed up if BABA 200 becomes the new 300. How many people thought it was a steal when it initially dropped into the 280s in early Nov?
I heard there‚Äôs a country that blocked people‚Äôs pandemic relief money on Christmas Eve. I feel so sorry for their people, must be some poor shitty third world country.

I feel like a significant portion of GOOG ads are bullshit. If you search say ‚ÄúTarget &lt;product&gt;‚Äù often the first result will be an ad for Target- but you were already planning on being a customer! Clicking that makes it seem like their ad worked. A lot of people will just click the first thing rather than scrolling down to the unpaid search result they asked for. Obviously sometimes a competitor shows up as the ad, which would be the intended goal. Wonder if companies will catch on that a lot of their ad spend is bs
28 percent on spaccccccs
If you give it the same P/S valuation that BBnB has it gives GME a 28 value. That's 20% on the upside.
Just being pinned by MMs at below $28 for options expiration.  When options activity is cleared the SP will move higher with ER in February. Own shares.

Dont care about loan forgiveness. I knew what i signed up for. I want some kinda of education, employment initiative like more focus on technical, trade schools, training programs that lead to stable jobs without needing wasting time in college. Too much gap between graduating high school and delivering pizza and the high cost of college that makes it out of reach.
The cheap prices were the real Christmas gift
All I know is someone from China jumped off a bridge after seeing Babas price today.
I did! I bought shares. I had luckily trimmed a majority of the position already after the earlier drop

Lol after how much ripped on the biz lately too.  At least getting money back from Amazon.
That‚Äôs everyday for me
im gonna get a tattoo of Cathie Wood on my left black asscheek

Fuck DKNG I‚Äôve lost a lot of money on calls that were like a dollar or 2 OTM with like a month till expiration and I would just bleed every day hoping it‚Äôd go up
Reading through the comments it seems you retards still think stimulus is happening. How many fucking times will congress keep dangling this out there and people still believe it. There is no 2k coming your way, now not even 600. Everything between now and the next Congress in January is just a song and dance so that people don‚Äôt start marching in the streets.
GME $12 on Monday you mean
Checked my RH recap just for fun. I made 840 trades between January and July. But more importantly, I earned 43¬¢ in dividends.
I‚Äôm fucking killing it in my Roth. Up 17% since 11/4 with only 60-70% or less even actively invested at any given time  If only I was as uninhibited with my main cash brokerage account...only up a little over 6% in the same timeframe  The main lesson here is yolos are rewarded. Don‚Äôt be a pussy

There's no premium for covered calls. I do monthlies and still only get around $0.40 or less for close to the money.

I'm gonna start a company called Pyramid Scheme Incorporated where all we do is print and sell shares. The more shares you have, the more dividends you get from the revenue from future share issuance. That's it. No gift shop or anything. Literally just a pyramid scheme.  Who wants in on the IPO?

**shoves finger straight through dolls asshole til it blasts out of its stomach**
Interesting that you say that. I have the same intuition.   It's funny, this move could be your big profit opportunity. Buying deep OTM puts as downside protection is very profitable when their is a big move downward. Trump transition presents this risk in and of itself, in addition to the other concerns e.g. market ATHs, stimmy issue, defense bill issue.   Good luck!

I wouldn‚Äôt invest either. I was just in it for the earnings play. That went wrong.
Ah yeah my bad it is a margin account.   Makes it even worse because I‚Äôm taking like 50% margin there to get 1/3 as good of returns as I‚Äôm getting in my Roth that isn‚Äôt even fully invested
lol trust me I'd prefer it wasn't a pandemic, we are down 60% on the whole year, PPP money ran out months ago and we probably won't get the next round for a couple months.   &amp;#x200B;  that being said our online sales have 3x'd this year which is great but not anywhere close to the revenue we had last year
Stimulus talks going well green all next week

Ended up down for this week. Not ideal. Thanking my lucky stars I had zero BABA. The fuckery of SQ, PLTR, and SE was a force to great to fight this week. Most calls at least 2 months out, so praying.
Anyone else‚Äôs RH after hours fucked up? Mine says down 0.6% but it‚Äôs been up 0.3% since 1:00.

No need. I got April $15 calls deep in the puss* I just hate how unrealistic sheeps are over here.
Also, don‚Äôt rush and buy it all at once, like split it in 2/3 and buy dips!
Different for everyone. Gotta meet your *basic* needs (not wants), everything after that is great.  But I think your question is the wrong question to ask
Get out üî´
For people who want to get into TSLA, but you‚Äôre sacred:  Tesla is a good buy ( for long term) no matter how expensive it is now(wait for dip tho). I see so many Tesla in Hong Kong today. I always knew Tesla is quite popular here(not a household name, but often mentioned in local forums) but I did not expect Tesla to be EVERYWHERE. Considering the fact that Tesla is not cheap, and there are so many cheaper options, seeing that many Tesla is mind-blowing. Can‚Äôt say for sure but buying Tesla dip never do you wrong. It reminds me of Apple (iPhone4 era).  But if the market crashes, your money üí∏üí∏üí∏.ü§°

Holy fuck my robinhood glitched when i opened and said I lost 5,000 for a sec
I bought 1/15 calls hopefully they print
Yeah that was the mistake that fucked me over. Up $300% on 12/24 PLTR calls and then I say do do do fuckin gonna buy more 12/24 calls on today, this beautiful 22nd day of dec, and then I realized how stupid that shit was
If jd dropped today along with baba. I woulda been extra dead. It was close enough to no change today for me to unload some

It will be back on Monday
Fucked up my own rules and didn't sell in premarket on FCEL and XL and lost around $1000 in gains today.
Just an okay week, after all.  $157 would have been $40k for the week, instead I took in about $25k in gains (selling and closing CSP) and now I‚Äôll own 7k shares of $ABNB at acb of $156.4.
You should try a nicotine addiction. Much cheaper
H&amp;M was trying to track me but apple didn‚Äôt allow it bought a share for protecting me
I sold FUBO at a small profit around 30. Despite the super run up after, glad I didn't get back in like two days ago. If goes back to 30s, I"ll rebuy.
I did learn a lesson, don‚Äôt buy calls the week they expire xd

WSB really created a pump and dump today huh
yeah i'm sure some are definitely hurting i'm being at least a little bit hyperbolic. i'm just sick of seeing all these people on twitter who surely don't patronize small or local businesses bitching about the government not helping them. lots of the businesses being propped up are businesses that were struggling anyways, personal checks to citizens would be a better use of funds than that.  all this of course is definitely not to say megacorps should be getting any sort of help at all from any stim package
Can you attach a bank on the Ally Mobile app?
Let‚Äôs hope, it had  a great run this last week and decided to drop off hard. I‚Äôve heard from multiple people they expect it to be in the high teens early 2021 but let‚Äôs pray

I did, did a transfer from the bank my employer uses for HSA to my brokerage. It ended up being a headache, the bank closed my HSA account which caused all proceeding contributions to get stuck in limbo for a while till I got it sorted. Funny enough, the transfer took like 3 weeks, and I ended up investing it all in index funds the night before the crash in March started.

If it's your first proper play take it easy mate, just get a appl/msft feb or march dated call ITM to test the waters, take the more risky plays on PLTR and shit once you're comfortable.

Bought 2x  $222.5 BABA calls when the stock was at $218.  At close I only had a $100 total gain.  Was that IV fuckery?  Feeling like the gain should have been about $400 with a .50 Delta.
the squeeze is inherent if it goes up a lot, the shorts can't just decide to never cover

The only people who hate Jack ma are the China men. The amount of anti Jack ma spam in here should be an example of how much Chinese influence is on this sub. Also they have small pp so lmao
Ok so after years of just bending the knee and letting China get away with human rights abuses, Jack Ma speaks out once after all these years he has just let injustice slip by and suddenly he's a beacon of freedom??? That's like calling Nazi scientist who helped Hitler massacre Jews saviors just because they spoke out against the Hitler...

I believe that HSA's a treated similar to IRAs in terms of options - you'll need to get approved by your brokerage, I use Fidelity and am qualified to sell CCs on my HSA and IRA, but no other forms of options - but you can unlock higher levels of options. Just need a large account and to email with them.
Yea I totally feel that especially this holiday season! Instead of paying a little extra to the  local coffee shop they have a starbucks cup on their insta. I also think that most of this "small business support" is gonna dry up next year when the world goes back to normal.   &amp;#x200B;  I go back and forth on the personal checks: most people used them to save or pay off debt we need people to spend it!! Maybe lower the income requirement and increase the amount of the check to get the cash out into the system??

The Virgin Fed - Works from home - Prints money at the problem - Gets bullied by Trump tweets  The Chad CCP - Probably drinks 1/3 the world‚Äôs supply of Remy Martin XO - Evaporates 100B market cap from BABA overnight cause CEO said naughty things - Wields people shut to stop virus
TSLA finna be messing up SPY returns for years to come since it's so overvalued... flat returns on SPY for a while.
I bought TSLA at the beginning of the week instead of QS, I know that feeling
That gay bear is also symbol of resistance to the cuck know as Xi. It's a tough choice, Be a communist? or Be a Gay bear?
I just told my friend that bears gaped my anus today over text. She has no idea what I‚Äôm talking about.
TBH I think BABA will do similar to CRM. Flat after the drop but slowly pick back up, you should be ok.
Yeah just be thankful you missed today.
You have 2 karma? Why would I disclose my Onlyfans money on Robinhood for you? I get free money from OF. Learn the way of the internet ho.

Some of the top threads on r/investing and r/stocks are ones telling you to sell BABA AFTER this drop. No wonder they never make any money.
****NOW IM MAD****   Didn‚Äôt I tell you to fkn get into I-P-O-B???  Didn‚Äôt I?? Look at it booming! The shit will hit 30 before Jan 6 merger   If it‚Äôs too far north get G H I V   HONORABLE not spac MENTIONS (plug and FCEL are crazy fire sale buys)
Lmao
Gotta keep up with the times. SPACs are backdoor IPOs in which a blank-check company IPOs and then finds a target to acquire/merge with.

I‚Äôm sorry I can‚Äôt hear you with such a little karma. Big karmas only please.
I wouldn't hold for long without protection because I don't see how they plan to protect themselves from general collapse of the market or society. If you want to dump you can, or you can hold for a little while to get a better price to dump at, but if you want to hold for a long time you should choose between either hedging the position with options protecting against a price crash or changing your mind about holding it long-term.
Maybe bcoz BABA is fuk!?

You do realize that TSLA is 1.6% of SPY. Even if Tesla goes to 0, SPY will only go down by 1.6%. Lol
Dont forget to claim the loss on your taxes. Uncle Sam giving me 3k to gamble a year is pretty nice, its just paying taxes on the front end if you lose

This goes against everything that happened today. Also, at like midnight last night I put in a sale on all of my pltr shares (26.53) the ten minutes later I cancelled my order. The market needs a ride through the year, too many big banks trying to make their 4th quarter look good.
I don't think its anything to worry about, it's a new ticker, can be volatile. I think when we get closer to Q4 results it'll be back up to 50s.

In my case because I broke my promise to myself to not get into any options positions to hold over an uncertain Christmas weekend unless I got a good buy in opportunity for gold calls. So now I'm sitting here worried about my options positions hoping they don't fuckin die on me because I went and traded something less certain than discount gold calls
so the guy that went from 6k to 100k in 2 days, bought monthly calls on XL  i just need to buy calls on the day an EV company closes it's merger with a SPAC?
Because we have nothing better to do

That stock is headed to the pinksheets. Hydrogen relies on electricity to produce so it will always be more expensive. The only reason why it was attractive was the fact that it offered greater range but now with battery tech, BaaS and solid state, its less of a problem for EVs.  Plus they got caught lying about their technology.  It's a Theranos.
Exquisite. Bonus points for it nearly being positive ah

BABA sale was a joke. Many institutional investors,  MMs were off today. What we saw - retailers panic selling at market price. On any normal day that would end at -6% most. Monday, when everyone's back to work we'll see helluwa fomo

Bought SPY at the bottom today, nice 40% gains
The year is 2025. House speaker Nancy pelosi's brain jar has agreed with Mitch McConnell's new human skinbody to vote on the $12 covid stimulus package. This is the 37th revision to the package initially introduced in late 2020. One dollar will be split between all americans, two between all illegal immigrants, and the rest to Jeff bezos. Due to stimulus hopes, SPY has rallied to 600.
How are those two things different, what are you investing in that you think is solid

Homemade covid test / For free   Step 1: Open a can of beer and try to smell it   Step 2: If you can smell the beer, drink it to see if you can taste it   Step 3: If you can taste it and smell it, this confirms you don‚Äôt have COVID  Last night, I did the test multiple times and all were negative. Tonight, I am going to do the test again because I woke up with a headache (another symptom of COVID) and feelink like I‚Äôm coming down with something.
Gah I was just talking about this happening last night, those candlesticks were on a death spiral
I got slaughtered on CRSR today.
I wonder how these MMs are able to sell off PLTR every fucking opening. Paperhands are non existent at this point.
It‚Äôs a market economy run by the state/govt, not a capitalistic market like the US. Market economy serves to keep the people productive and working, not for capitalistic purposes.

Monday? Unknown. Is this the top? Probably not.  In the long run, if GME can carve out even a 10% of the gaming market and hold it down, it‚Äôs not going anywhere. Shorts initially started with a Blockbuster scenario and made good money shorting it on the way down. Now they most likely have to contend with a longer time frame.   Regardless of a short squeeze, I don‚Äôt believe GME is in danger of bankruptcy. What you‚Äôre seeing in the price action right now is a fight between shorts and longs. This shit has almost completely detached from trading with the market as a whole, indicating unique underlying movement and pressure.

BABA has lost 30% of it's value in the last two months.   In order for it to reclaim former ATH at 317ish it would need to see 42% growth.  Do with this information what you will
bro...?
ye bought back in too and it sucks
I hope so. 60% down

Volatile stock and the market overall has been in kangaroo mode.
Congress already passed the stimulus you dolt. Trump has to sign the omnibus bill into law for you to get the $600. The $2000 is not included in that and is a separate thing now.   Basically the government will shutdown Tuesday. If it shuts down you‚Äôre getting no stimulus. If it doesn‚Äôt, you might not get stimulus.
Would def be nice if hyln stopped being garbage
 not actually true bro lol

When I was younger I thought the stock market was some crazy Advanced thing. Now I'm deep in it and enjoying it and making money. Not a lot of money granted, but it's still wild to think I'm a part of it
Market was much more chill than I expected today. This is insanely bullish. The market will continue to be fed at a higher rate plus another injection. I‚Äôm glad to see investing become mainstream and practical. Tech ironically has made it so much easier to invest therefor pumping tech.

Anyone silently riding up the FUSE warrants? 3k at $0.91, 120% and not even any news yet.
The potential is there but it just so fuckn disappointing
Yeah I‚Äôm barely down. I‚Äôd even say flat. That DD is looking at irrelevant data. The world has changed in 2020. The stock market is a new monster.
Investing is finding companies with good long term prospects for generating revenue and holding positions for years at a time. My current plays here are ARKG and ICLN, I expect those to 2-10x between now and 2030.   Gambling is trying to play shorter term trends, take advantage of investor psychology, looking to ramp up risk for greater potential reward.   Unless you have incredibly disciplined bankroll management, gambling in the way WSB does is a near guarantee to go to zero.
DASH looks like it might run next week
Why doesn't CCP just flat out take BABA - they are communist, they can do whatever they want.
Sounds like elevator down next week with trump stimulus veto.
Lol imagine being happy
Unless you have hundreds of thousands in that, you‚Äôd never know. (Also maybe you do?) Disclaimer, I am very retarded
I know. It‚Äôs like my kids.
What‚Äôs a good entry for FUBO and what price can you see it reaching in the next year or so
you feel robbed because you are. RH charges 2.5% lol
What is even happening with PLTR I feel like it‚Äôs gotta be the most manipulated stock out there rn. Of course I got calls on it
TPL if you have a big cock
After it ate all the cmg?
Kids, unwrap your presents early we're taking them back to the store. China made them and now they're taking them back.
What's the ticker for China?
time to sell covered calls on PLTR until my cost basis goes to 0 and the stock is still trading at $25-$28 next year
Haha that‚Äôs gold

So should I leave this sub like the mods
If you're in the Christmas giving spirit, don't forget to toss a few tendies to our boy who gave us [WSB Synth](https://wsbsynth.com/)!
Congress passed the omnibus bill already. Trump either signs it, vetos, or ignores it until the congressional session is over on 1/4. Then they have to pass the bill through congress again.   The $2000 stimulus is separate thing now.

GYNA of course
Look at all dat head, all dat head inside dat hair
What's considered a dividend stock? Literally any stock with a dividend or does it have to have 1% yield?  If it's literally any stock with a dividend, it's MSFT, AAPL, and NVDA.   If it has to have 1%, it's probably JNJ
Getting dangerously close to 25k in the Roth and the glory of tax free daytrading  Debating just depositing and extra few k in to pass the barrier and taking the 6% penalty hit just so I can do it now
I feel seen
Why, you won't hold it more than a week anyway.

Jan 22 became quite affordable today. I doubled down to protect myself by adding one of those and one Jun, both with crazy Low targets of 250,260
uh I think you're thinking about fundamentals like P/E forward ratios. I am just noting facts about the magnitude of this price movement. didn't make a statement about valuation or sentiment, where do you see one

RIP quarantrader.   His gravestone read:
At least you‚Äôre not borrowing from TD at 9%  RH really trailblazing with 2.5  The only one I know beating them is interactive brokers which I believe lends at 1.65% or something like that as long as you have 25k min

I‚Äôd be up 115% if I didn‚Äôt try out options on CRSP. It just broke even last week. This seems like the perfect stock to do CC or CSP‚Äôs with. It‚Äôs got good premium and low volume

A lot of WSB memes other than TSLA were red today, which is where the panic you read here is coming from. But the overall market was not bad.
this week yea, today was a soft -6%
In need to work tomorrow in the morning. , some xannies to get some sleep. Some beer to enjoy, won 1 k today I‚Äôm fine
[removed]
Yeah if it‚Äôs just the 6% I‚Äôm definitely doing it but I think it‚Äôs more complicated than that...like you may be liable for gains made off that excess contribution. Haven‚Äôt dug deeply into the code for it yet so not 100% sure

What's more likely:   1. China says, "just kidding, you guys can buy the dip now" 2. China says, "you fucked up, Jack, *we* are *still* the Captain.  Go sit in timeout while we figure out how to make an example of you"

We‚Äôre not China. We have a dem pres with a boner for green energy. Literally has nothing to do with what‚Äôs going on over there.

Well maybe I‚Äôm just a dumb stupid idiot cause I just deleted the app and restarted my phone then downloaded the app and logged in and everything seems fine so hopefully it was just a glitch and no harm done. The update doesn‚Äôt seem worth it either lol happy holidays bud have a good one
Nio is great but I wouldn‚Äôt play battery day.
That‚Äôs what I was thinking also. I want to wait until my NIO shares reach 100-200k in my Roth then drop it all in T and let it ride until I‚Äôm ready to retire.

That's pretty good, but a great c-suite and bullish macro-trend is necessary but insufficient.   For me the sticking point in their business model. how do they see growth going forward when most games are downloaded from online play stores and most consoles are bought online?
R/investing told me to avoid BABA, so of course I went all in because that means it bottomed out.
You think that‚Äôs bad, look at what happened to pltr
think your over diversifying.. you only got 5k better to go balls to the wall on something your extremely confident about
Don‚Äôt forget the entirety of congress

NIO will have life my young scrotum
Ibkr offers great rates but their margin requirements are so high you can barely use it. Not to mention their crazy auto liquidate feature lol. I swapped to TD just to avoid all that since I don't use margin much anymore anyways.
Why FSR tho. I've considered but by the time they have a viable product they'll be in a crowded market, hoping people are willing to rent their vehicles and their shtick on the greenest EV will be a large enough economic moat to differentiate.

‚ÄúTarget became a prominent example of another kind of personal data vulnerability, when the New York Times detailed how the retail chain analyzed shopping patterns to determine which of its customers were probably pregnant. Target then sent them ads for relevant products, in one case outing a 15-year-old girl who hadn‚Äôt told her father about her pregnancy.‚Äù   Lmaooooo I didn‚Äôt know this happened to target a couple years ago, fuck. Lol
squats   burpees
Ima give u some advice. Take it or leave it but it worked for me. The one day you take off - use that day to go on a hike. Preferably somewhere there is a payoff at the end. Go to Alltrails and just search for some shit near you.  It‚Äôs not a fuck ton of serotonin or anything but it‚Äôs a lot less soul sucking then watching your calls expire otm. Just makes the 12 hour grind little worth it when you planned a cool hike end of week u know?

Oh damn, yeah I've never used ibkr as a broker...only recently looked up their rates after RH cut theirs. What is this auto liquidate feature?

It‚Äôs always a bull market if you‚Äôre looking in the right place.   RMG, STIC were up 20%+ today. QS was up 4% BLNK up 13% today.
E-commerce already represents more than 20% of their top line. They already have a deal with Microsoft in place. They get a cut of every digital purchase on Xbox they sell. And I believe this may be just the start. Besides, on fundamentals only, their current e-commerce sales (meaning without new consoles yet) already justify a 2 billion market cap
See you in Vegas beta bets
wow..  i would have a panic attack over that
Just spit my drink out
Yeah you're far from fine mate
I didn‚Äôt see anything üë®üèª‚Äçü¶Ø
When does crm dip breakout my ass needs help
They don't have margin calls they just start selling your shit lol.   And their requirements were insane it was like 75% of value for Tesla stock while I was there. Made it impossible to daytrade shares on margin. So it all looks great on paper but in practice it's pretty much useless since you can't really utilize it as much as with other brokers who are more laxed. I rather pay a higher percentage for when I want to use margin rather than pay a low apr but have barely any access to it.
Either I‚Äôm a genius or I‚Äôm fucking retarded. Holding $375c‚Äôs
Find a third
100% for sure
So are we done doubting G(HIV)+? Or are we still hooked on the sexy girls in the room? I hope yall got in on the pre-holiday dip, might not look back from here.

I don't understand why so many people use margin with such high interest. Ibkr has great rates, even Robinhood is now 2.5%. why not switch?
I agree with all of that except you can‚Äôt target fat burning in a specific area. Crunches will burn fat yeah, but it‚Äôll burn fat evenly throughout your whole body.
No
Merry Christmas Eve, ya fuckers. See y'all next week for new year rally.
You also need at least 10k steps a day it‚Äôs very important, cool more, got out less things like that. You want like 4 good lean meals a day that were actually prepared. Sorry I use to work at a body building meal prep place and telling people to eat less is the last thing they need to hear lmaoooo
I haven‚Äôt been alive during a bear market yet

There are no rules her anymore boy

So many times this year Ive woken up hungover and had a covid panic. Lesson not learned.
Back in the day when I bought my 970 UPS pulled the same bullshit.  I came home and someone was on my porch playing with the package, ran off when I got home (it was a little kid), and I emailed them and they said they were under zero obligation to do anything.  I should‚Äôve said something but I was just glad to have my GPU.
Pretty solid right?

My sincere hope is that Monday turns red, mixed at best, because Trump has made no indication whether or not he's signing, and Monday is the last day before a potential shut down. I liquidated a good chunk of my portfolio and I have orders placed but they're not filling.
cramer actually suggest buying options? i never hear him say that
Just saying the wrong publication does a piece about it and then Reddit admins may have to shut us down or something to do PR control

Just need another week of 10 baggers and then maybe I‚Äôll owe some taxes
Damn that sucks. For like 5 months I was driving an hour each way just to work out at this one gym here that was open and had no Covid rules. No masks nothing. But the gas and time was killing me I could only go in the morning bc of work and then I‚Äôd miss the whole market day haha.  You guys living together? No drama? Lots of couples can‚Äôt stand each other after being home alone together for a whole year lol.   I remembered when you were riding that SPCE wave to $40 lol

Agree. I really love hiking and it's a good reset. If you tell me you were state I could give you some recommendations about where to go
I could and was tempered to do it but a -5% or +5% day could easily blow my entire account
Why the spy hate?
always look out for the plays wsb doesnt mention. RKT it is
Ah yes, I understand. Even Ibkr crashed a while back. But with Ibkr you can atleast call customer care (24x7) and close out position in an emergency. It's been good for me so far.  What about Schwab? Heard great things about it, and customer service is good too, or so I've heard
Lots of spacs with good leadership still on the table

I mean he could be right, I'm not saying one way or another.    I'm just saying it shouldn't necessarily be bullish news. Because he's not infallible. I don't care what other investors moves are, because they can still lose money just like me

Follow all of the ark dudes on twitter if you wanna learn how smart people think

In that case, why not call them up? I've heard from many people that you can actually negotiate a better rate. If you've been with them for long, perhaps you can convince them how much you like their platform and neg for a better rate  Not sure though, but worth a shot

Outside of few cities, it‚Äôs all RED in this state. Atlanta and it‚Äôs surrounding neighborhood will vote for Dems but even among Dems, there‚Äôs a split here. For every 8 political commercials on TV, 5-6 are all Perdue and Loeffler attacking Warnock and Ossoff. Ossoff is being called a liar and that he can‚Äôt be trusted. Perdue running fear mongering commercials that if they elect Ossoff, Dems will defund the police, increase illegal immigration, raise taxes etc. it‚Äôs shit show down here

That‚Äôs hot as fuck
I‚Äôm new to call options and have 12/31 $53c on SNAP. Should I pull out now and take the loss? If it doesn‚Äôt hit the strike price will I lose it all? Will I lose more if I hold? Sorry I‚Äôm new
Need some confirmation bias that my big position in Donavan mcVAXnabb was a good play and it‚Äôs on its way back up soon.
I‚Äôll go in 30k if he splits
No, it makes it more likely. People are less likely to sell as they anticipate a squeeze. It‚Äôs also attracting buyers.

Yeah bro, I honestly have found that getting the news from straight financial channels really cuts through the bullshit and opinions that other outlets give.
Lethal Weapon is also set around Christmas.
not really the person to ask but, i would say it has limited risk becuase the book value is pretty solid and idk abt the rest of the business though. should look into that further

&gt; Should I pull out now and take the loss?   Depends on your risk tolerance   &gt; If it doesn‚Äôt hit the strike price will I lose it all?   Yes and no. At expiration yes, there's a break even price. At any point before, no you can sell it for profit/loss regardless where the ticker is  &gt; Will I lose more if I hold?   Unless you're selling options, no buying them you only lose what you put in   &gt; Sorry I'm new  Ban

Yeah the closer to the expiry date you are the more the contract loses value depending on how far away from the strike price
What you do is make a wild call and then close up shop if it doesn't hit.  Start a new company and try again till you get a winner. Now you can boast about how smart you are and how everyone should listen to your company.  *this is probably illegal and you shouldn't do this

Trying to decide b/w leaps and shares.  I think shares is the way.  You don't have to fight Theta.  Stock can take years to break out.    Although leaps, you are controlling more shares with lot less capital.   As im thinking, shares I think are the way.   Those ridiculous gains that hit the front page here are 1 / 1000.   The others are getting gang banged by Theta and Gamma finishes them with triple orgasm.

You need a lot of credit cards btw. I only have two and am stuck in the 700s.
My guy. I‚Äôve been playing this shit since it was 10 dollars. Friday‚Äôs are always dump usually. Followed by Monday‚Äôs where there‚Äôs a morning pop. Then you have Tues-Wednesday where there‚Äôs sometimes a nice rally.   There‚Äôs too much opportunity cost out there for people. I love the company but it‚Äôs the truth that there‚Äôs plays if you‚Äôre looking for a quick grab.   Good luck.
I looked at it yesterday and decided against it, so at minimum +10% Monday

Then don't use options pussy. But in all seriousness it's better to just roll it out of your still believe in the play, like I almost never do weeklies. You won't get a 10 bagger but you also won't lose it all

Yeah besides the virus of course the economy is usually booming, lots of money in the country! Country is polically and ideological very safe, stable and peaceful. Just an all around Nice chill place to live to be honest.. Although the weather is fucking shitttttttt. Things have also gotten very expensive here in the last 10/15 years due to the amount of money in the country. I'd recommend anyone moving here stay away from Dublin its the exact same as any city in Europe ( but way uglier imo)   Its nice having the government that will help pay for things such as healthcare, college, very good welfare support system etc.. Just makes you feel.. Idno.. Safe? Now because of that system we pay high taxes which sucks but id rather have it this way imo  Yeah haha our food here is just pretty much a mix of all the other world cuisines with some of our own dishes ( not many stand out Irish dishes at all lol ).. Like if I was to eat out in England I'd get nearly the exact same food as I would in Ireland! People say our food is boringly unoriginal because we just use so many other countries dishes but atleast as a visitor you wouldn't struggle to find the exact same food / dishes / restaurants  you'd find back in America! Today for dinner we made an Indian dish and yesterday and Italian pasta haha!

Succession is phenomenal.
Puts seem too obvious. Therefore calls.
What you described is literally the situation that DCA is designed for. Don't do it if you don't have capital to spare though.
The parks are still very lucrative and by all accounts should bounce back with people desperate to get over lockdowns and restrictions. And their commitment to making so many new shows will not only elevate Disney Plus in the streaming market, but the Star Wars brand as a whole.

Can see this not getting signed until Biden is in office.  4. A lot of people about to get kicked out of their houses / apartments bc eviction‚Äôs can begin occurring again.  5. We are just overall at generally overbought levels. Just look at the Russell 2000. Most managers anticipating 5-10% pullback.   Personally, IWM $185 for end of January looking extremely juicy.

Thank you Jerome for destroying any prospects for middle class americans. Fucking housing prices up 20-40% since feb, salaries effectively 10-15% lower, while goods prices are going up. We need deflationary spiral to clean this all up.

Guess what? Yes, I forgot the market closes at 1pm and left a bunch of short term puts open.   Oh well.
I think a lot of people are going to be disappointed in the long run. QQQ &amp; now QQQJ can be a great alternative with less fees and more consistency.

So this baba thing is a probe. This shit happens here with tech companies. Did FAANG plummet no. I guess the difference is this more of a capitalist system than China and so there will never be any breaking up of monopolies. In China there‚Äôs a possibility. Although, I would guess highly unlikely because politics is the same everywhere. Those in power are influenced by those with money. Baba won‚Äôt be fined or broken up and will be ATH once the probe is over.

Imagine using old reddit, get with the times old man.   We use the new reddit with Jim Cramer as the wsb baby
Basically a blank check company sets up a shell company with money from institutions at $10 a share. Generally they amass $100 million to $700 million, although some are now in the billions. The SPAC finds a private entity looking to go public, comes to an agreement on valuation/equity, and then announce an agreement.   It‚Äôs essentially buying a mystery box at $10 a share and you find out in 1-10 months what‚Äôs in it. The shares are protected with a $10 trust floor, meaning that if shit hits the fan you can always redeem your shares at $10 until a merger is approved. Almost always once the target company is announced the share price goes up anywhere from $11-$30. If you buy around $10 you have almost zero risk of losing money. Biggest loss is opportunity cost of your money sitting at $10 while waiting for an announcement.

To add some tips to my other comment, here are some things that helped me: buy shares and stay far away from options. But you probably won't listen so if/when you do options again, don't buy weeklies and don't risk too much of your portfolio in them. Personally I try to maintain at least 90% shares, 10% or less options. And implement some other rules that force you to stop/reevaluate/learn more etc if you're losing too much (whatever that means to you).    Also margin has been really helpful but **only use it for shares, and hopefully safe/long term ones**. Going crazy with margin can kill you. It's essentially a loan for investing so be really careful

As a medical doctor I don‚Äôt recommend taking either vaccine. Just because one that shit alters your dna üß¨ and long term side effects ie 2-3 year have not been seen due to expeditious nature of the rollout. Only benefit to taking the vaccine I can see is if you are hoping for a black swan and getting super powers from altering your dna

So I am $325 in the pocket today. That's a $40/hr job right there.
well if there's a Democrat house majority, senate majority, and president that really puts the spotlight on them...pretty much whatever action they take will be solely attributed to Democrats  I expect a sudden turn around of positivity from the MSM if this happens, otherwise the focus will just be "everything would've worked out perfectly except for those darn R senators"  I think its silly to think these people aren't working together in numerous ways to enrich themselves at the taxpayer's expense, regardless of party affiliation

Great advice.   I actually was not doing a lot of options, but laveraged CFDs that I paperhanded. Also usually trades after I got some good results - textbook greed to be honest.  I have 2 accounts. One for long term investments (which is doing ok. I lost tons on Wirecard, but that was special), and other for swings or daytrades. I keep the accounts separated so I'm not yoloing my long term buys.   Guess which one is the trouble kid?   I gotta get my shit together and stol daytrading and do more swings actually waiting for good accession, not forcing the recovery.   I when I lost 4k I wanted to get it back quickly and her ei am. 8k loss in 4 days

No biggest loss would be if the spac picks a shit target, or makes a poor deal. It‚Äôs lower risk, but spacs aren‚Äôt risk free.  Spacs usually have a lifespan of 2 years, if they can‚Äôt find a target shares are returned to shareholders at NAV. This may incentivize the spac to pick a company to bring public, even if that company is shit.

Love to hear it. Too many fucking idiots with debt on top of debt. Good job.
Nm 100$ isnt enough to start
Ok yeah you are just really confused  There's 900B relief bill that has passed congress with a veto proof majority. Trump just needs to sign it, and if he doesnt it becomes law in 10 days. That contains the $600 as well as multiple other relief measures. It contains exactly 0 foreign aid    There's an omnibus bill of 1.4T that contains funding for tons of things, including the foreign aid people are whining about. This was passed in congress in conjunction with the 900B relief plan, making for a total 2.3T spending plan. This too is waiting a signature from trump  Finally, there's that 2k check trump wants and is why he's sitting on both the 1.4T omnibus bill and the 900B covid19 relief bill. Today, house democrats attempted to rush something through that will add it to the stimulus, but it required unanimous consent, and several republicans said no. On monday itll most likely go to a more formal vote and pass the house.

Ironically the more money you have the less you can pay your taxes. That is because the IRS is severely underfunded and cannot afford people lawyering up. This was probably done in purpose for obvious reasons

It doesn‚Äôt have the be a bad Christmas. Money, women, stuff in general shouldn‚Äôt effect your mood. The sooner you realize that relying on external things to change the way you feel internally doesn‚Äôt work, the more free you will be.   My recommendation, if you are around others right now and have been acting/feeling pouty - tell them you‚Äôre going to change your mood and you‚Äôll be back in a little. Go on a walk or go sit in a room alone and decide that you‚Äôre going to have a good Christmas. Stay in the room or on the walk until you can make this deal with yourself then come out. Hope you have a good Christmas dude.

What‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs opinion on sbux? Does it have a lot of room to grow still? I always feel weird about food companies because like how much growth could they possibly have planned compared to tech

Of course I don‚Äôt, what sub do you think we‚Äôre posting on.
Just became eligible for my company‚Äôs 401K. Best performing (and highest risk) index I am allowed to select is up 16% on the year.  I did 16% today on my own
Don‚Äôt tell them anything. They‚Äôll ruin those too.

A lot of people on socials are showing off their COVID vaccine card for internet cool points. I noticed Pfizer listed as the company, free advertising! Pfizer to the moon next week (30 cents)!
Buy one
They also said that at 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24. I'm seeing a trend here
Markets closed tomorrow
same for me. feels kinda wrong doing so well when so many are suffering. hope next year is better for everyone
üòÇ China bots in this thread
Bet you can also do -100% on your own in a day too.
wire me your cash and ill do it for you!
Fucking patience bro.
How have you met more people this year than on average lol
I'm starting a secret Santa futures trading group.  Load up on shorts if you think you got socks but maybe it's a PS5.  Open through Christmas. Fuck em pussy boys at NYSE that need time off to see family.
psych reads were dead on
Fuck yeah dude I always hedge my bigger positions with $SPY too. It‚Äôs fucked me a few times on weird stock specific news but very rarely do my picks drops without the rest of the market going with it.
well that escalated quickly.   Try the dark web.
THB.R
you can have mine, i want a new one
When is lockup ?
Apply for a fire depo position in a small quite town. You will have plenty of free time to you lurk on WSB and lose money oh RH while doing pull ups and push ups in the engine bay.
Be careful of expense ratios on 401K funds. They had me in some 2% fund that tracks domestic and international bonds. Lmao switched that to Vanguard 500, been smooth sailing since.
The older I‚Äôve gotten, the less I‚Äôve cared about women‚Äôs looks

Imagine thinking stimulus is going to ever happen. Silly poors.
Icln gang, standing by
Only the Godless heathen countries
Lazy Yankees always taking days off
When will options be available ?
So, wait for another dip and buy?
But was it tax free?
Why do you think that we're gonna bust through to $33 before the lockup?
Yeah I‚Äôve done -70% before in a day, lol. But that was when I had only $4000 in my portfolio and did all in on Tesla for battery day. Lol.
Already has
The first step to losing money is watching futures
If it's not them it'd be someone else. I don't like it either but the data mining has been going on for the last decade plus. Google and FB know more about you than your parents do. RH sells your order flows.   I'm just here to make money so I'm not getting fucked as hard by the man.
Pay some taxes at least
Ban this dumb fuck

I'm in N G A right now and expect it to fly once it merges with Lion Electric and changes the ticker to LEV. I'm in T H C üêù since $11 and still holding. Made a killing on P I C (now X L)
Monday  Is we pumping or is we pumping
Shit you right, your personal habits are indicative of the entire market! All the people camping in front of GME on Black Fridayand inside of the store for the last month must have actually been hallucinations. I really need to stop doing acid while I do DD

I use my 401k as protection from me red dildoing my ass from time to time.
I bought feb calls also today.  Good luck!
stone island turtleneck, and nkla drilled like bp wishes they could
Wut
So high risk reward for bottoms haha
We use Vanguard too, I have yet to figure out how to switch to indexes that are outside my company‚Äôs plan. Never used vanguard before
It's not tho.. The company is showing green numbers, covid had turned the world to work differently. PCs in the households are increasing, number of people streaming is more than ever, nber of gamers are constantly increasing.  Corsair is definitely not undervalued for its potential market cap. And they make some of the best products out there, a lot better than Razr and are Logitech.  The price has dipped, but it will continue to rise long term, the company is most likely the best in its franchise and had a lot of room to grow.
Just shat and wiped and it was completely clean. Not like 99% clean, 100% fucking clean
bullish, the "govt" is half the problem.
You don't want a girl that's with you for the money so that's good.
And the fundamentals haven‚Äôt changed that whole time. This company is obsolete and will be out of business soon. WSB coordinating a pump and dump doesn‚Äôt change that.
hi
Those numbers make me sick. I know I have no reason to feel like I missed out but I do. Took a lot of restraint to not fomo buy a put or two this morning
My brother is homeless for Christmas for the first time ever, feels weird man
Been there. Fuck prime day 2019
"allegedly" penny shilling...made the mistake of posting something without a trillion dollar market cap...

Boomers really are retarded for putting their accounts in this shit
Congrats
Man. Theta going to be eating my nio and pltr calls all long ass weekend.
Sounds like cancer
Merry Christmas you cockslurpers.  You helped me make so much money this year, I'm not even kidding.  Except I passed on GME.  Fuck you.  Maybe next year.
7c 1/15 at 1.15 here. I think we‚Äôre in good shape but I‚Äôm a fucking idiot so who knows
Their most recent ER confirms what I said
After this years market gains, those dips would get bought up so fast.
Europe will moon the market next week.  Brexit news n shit.

Merry X-mas you retards thanks for helping a new (+newly unemployed-fuk you CA) dad make some money. My first purchase was PLTR + ASAN on the direct offering -we're up 21k since
Damn Ive ripped off in the past guess i have to do more research before buying
Go back and tell her you work at Wendy's, so she knows you have stuff in common and gives you a shot.
Idc what the price tag is, no one looks good in a turtleneck. And congrats on the nkla gains!
Ah yes, classic buy the news

Anyone still locking gains or tax loss harvesting will be finishing up Monday and Tuesday so their trades can settle within the 2020 tax year. There is also the potential for more stimulus/budget vote shenanigans so you might not be totally hosed.
Infinity DTE shares.  I trust Cathie enough not to gamble on her lol
I have 6c for that date and I‚Äôm not worried. Was up over 100% the day I bought it but fucking day trade restricted. If you read some of their threads it‚Äôll definitely make you feel better about it for now but come Monday we‚Äôll have a better idea
Think about it like this bro ‚ÄúI could have anyone of them but I‚Äôm in no rush.‚Äù
Guh fubo
Just hoping we get back to ATH of 33.50 sometime in the next 4 weeks. If that happens, I‚Äôm out and exit with $100,000 gainz. I‚Äôm long term bullish but pretty sure there is gonna be a dump of shares, once lock up expires. Not interested in bag holding.

Im burning through jobs as well, i miss the people but the companies i was with were for a quick check anyways, basically prostitution.
Tax free, 3.5% max match and when you put in 6%
Did I fuck up buying the baba dip?
What‚Äôs a good entry for fubo? feel like this thing will be triple digits I‚Äôm the future.
baba going to 100s soon :S
I like this idea
Another 10-15% sounds likely
If you didn‚Äôt convert your calls into shares over a long weekend then you ain‚Äôt even black
BABA is nothing like Luckin‚Äôs accounting scandal. Big nothing burger for BABA will jump 5-10% on Monday. I bought my kid a Winnie Pooh Toy to celebrate it.
Vanguard is a wonderful company. Look up what the founder did for us average shmucks. I have my entire Roth and 401K with them.
Read: the company I work for
Well, I‚Äôm no expert on the matter. Maybe. Maybe not.
What‚Äôs the Monday moves !
Theragrippers
Even more bad news?
What‚Äôs GME doing Monday ?
From one degenerate to another, well done.  Cheers to many more gains.
Isn‚Äôt that already applied at close?
Ban
Then Brexit happening the week after will dip the market back to Earth.
This is a stay at home stock that has benefited from covid and guess what? Covid is coming to an end. You still holding Home Depot too?
lol :( baba going to get yeeted to like 100s soon, May buy if they declare bankrupcy for the rocket
NVDA boys I know you saw the dark pool volume last few days. Today was the perfect dip to buy for March and June. February earnings. Textbook consolidation for a month. The boys upstairs been loading up. Big bets placed on news coming soon.
Good on you. I went autist and bought 12/31‚Äôs
CHINESE COMPANIES CAN ALL GO FUCK THEMSELFS AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED.
When I hear that the strength of the dollar is projected to drop by 15% in the next two years, that makes me a lot less impressed about a 30% gain. Things are going to get a lot more expensive.
which ark did cathie put baba in?
All in baba. U guys autistic if u think China will destroy its poster child. Ma gonna hit up mr Pooh, bow and apologize &amp; this shit gonna moon  $BABA üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

How about $30C by jan 15
Would be a nearly half trillion dollar company. Would clearly have a major impact and would probably take down other china stonks
So they decided to drop all the good news after close

Listen u horses asses, are my Jan 2022 nio calls safe? $47 strike. Shits down $900 right now. All I can see in my mind is something like baba happening on Monday. Tell my nervous ass nio back to $50 soon.
When the "tech bubble" bursts I'm gonna be the first one to buy the dip. Who with me?

After ‚Äúcatching the bottom‚Äù over and over for the last month I finally leaned my lesson and dumped this chink scam and holy lord did it feel good. RIP to all the BABA bag holders out there you will never financially recover from this one.

I‚Äôll look more into it. I know of it. I think that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been doing the whole time but I‚Äôm retarded. From what I see from my short time here is that as long as you‚Äôre not making crazy weekly otm calls you make gains in meme stocks. As long as they‚Äôre at least like 6 weeks out. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been doing.... and it‚Äôs working üöÄ
so your gonna wait for everything to run up and let all of us make profits, and then when it bursts 6 months - 1 year later you're gonna hope it makes another run? why not just get in now lol

Gonna be so funny when then CCP commies it up and nationalizes BABA.
Thanks! And anyone down voting does not know how to celebrate tendies.
And? Who would rather see their brother homeless on the streets than give him a couch because of the risk that he will overstay his welcome. That's some messed up family values
You joking? Or you‚Äôre expecting it to spike?
Currently sitting on 7 different SPACS with 1K in warrants of each. Just hold them. Literally will make you money if you are anywhere near NAV.
I step away from the market for a day and you all sink it? Cmon fellas
Put that toilet paper right back on the roll!
its a trap!
NIO has no reason to fall only good news incoming and they are directly controlled by the CCP. Baba is gunna be ok in the long run the company has more potential than Amazon, people are just so fucking dramatic and forget fundamentals
Amzn
Potential growth compensates for the risk. This is BABA not done bullshir stock. If u want 100% safe stick to a savings acct or s&amp;p

i think nio is a good bet if you give yourself more time, jan might be a roller coaster with the senate race, stuff might go nuts upward or downward, dudes will shift their portfolios and NIO might be a huge beneficiary or the other way around. im gambling a lot but its mostly with my profits, i still got some loser AAPL Square Paypal GM blah blah leaps
If you‚Äôre feeling down about your plays, just think about all the people hoarding Xboxs and PS5s in their garages about to be the ultimate bag holders.    Makes me smile everytime I‚Äôm down knowing there‚Äôs someone out there about to be absolutely fucked with all the consoles they‚Äôve got in their garages trying to scalp them for the holidays
Same haha, that‚Äôs why i like to see what other people think as well. I mean i think good news and a request for more trucks could make it take off again. It‚Äôs much lower than it‚Äôs $50+ high a month ago.   I got 6 HYLN 4/16 25s. Didn‚Äôt want to go too far OTM
Like?
no idea
You don't think the way people operate on daily bases has changed? You don't think companies that used to spend thousands of dollars on employes traveling for meetings will change company policy? Do you think streaming will suddenly decrease when Covid is gone?   I don't own Home Depot, but if you cannot understand that covid has changed a lot in our societies than you are a fool. And FYI, Covid will be a part of our lives for a minimum of two more years.. we won't be going back to our offices until 2022.
He turned it off. We flying solo
Just tell them you can't.
To all the loud BABA bears today. I dont wanna hear no bitching next month when everyone is posting gain pornos
He was responsible for actively moderating the place with all of his auto mods and whatnot. Without him none of the other mods do jack shit and this place is essentially a floating, rudderless derelict.
Anyone wanna chain donate and match? $20. Call it white elephant charity.  Obviously to a charity.
I dont think so. He left before this daily thread came up so idk what the fuck is going on

Baba actually makes money
Not gonna stop me from watching it
im looking at it now. ive got 18 shares that cost about same as atm call jan 21 22. that sounds like 5 to 1 to me. add a put for the same price would make it 2.5 to 1 leverage. knowing greeks would be helpful, delta, gamma theta

I'm a white American male in my thirties. Suck it.
I backtest strategies similar to yours and have a program that scans the market for tickers that meet my technical requirements for entry each day.  I would suggest adding an RSI component to your requirements.  Bear in mind that as the market changes, these strategies need tweaking. It‚Äôs a bit more complicated than you assume, but not by much.   Don‚Äôt be a bitch and use a strategy like this to buy stock. Calls only, mf. If you want to minimize risk then do diagonals.
The second company I was with legit have a mass exodus of all of its lower level employees, luckily I was the first one because I heard shit got right there when management caught on
You know how when you cum inside a woman some of your seman infect her brain and make her smarter? Which man did this to cathie wood? I want to follow his moves in stocks
to retards with FD calls, -0.7% in a day is a world ender
Probably, but at that price why not just buy shares?
Every time it drops a couple dollars tho, it fuckin slingshots back up. Just the Ark way.
I dunno I don‚Äôt know Chinese
those SPACs could go down following their respective mergers so that risk is still there. For those without targets, the risk of direct listing very much threatens them.
Im so fucking jealous of people who started trading in march/april. Literally free money no matter what you bought

Most sold too early, and are now regretting it. In other words, still retarded.
No one believed it would go up. That‚Äôs what made it difficult

I never said NIO had a lot of revenue did I? They have similar revenue but the TAM for NIO is exponentially larger than Palantir. There is no chance PLTR can maintain their current growth rate whereas NIO will likely continue to accelerate.

Shut up bitch
Id say 1/5 of wsb got wiped out by baba today
It never was
I was sitting on some cash at the time but I had to stay completely liquid because I had some legal fees and needed to purchase a vehicle and insure it and such.... It was unfortunate that I had to sit it out but at least I was holding 100 shares of NET the whole time.

Certainly a point of discussion: wsb.gold
lost 40k today.  Whoooo BABA
More
On calls that expired. I'm making money on SRNE though.
Looking to buy calls for mid January to Feb. What's the üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ that will take me to the moon?
Likewise asshole! Now go fuck yourself!
Yeah I‚Äôve never really dropped much cash on options so haven‚Äôt really thought about hedging but I guess it makes sense since leaps are expensive so lot to lose if it goes sideways. I‚Äôll probably either do that or just buy shares
Are you literally retarded?
I‚Äôm in it but just shares because I‚Äôm a wallstreet bitch.  I‚Äôll join you on the moon
I wonder if anyone had 1/2 of their portfolio in BABA. Sad. Not supposed to happen to a huge successful company.
Monthlies are the way if you are going to do anything. Obviously the gains for weeklies can be insane but so can losses. Leaps are dope too. Gives you ease of mind which is actually nice
PLTR
Melvin, Melvin, Melvin... When will you learn? You're playing against literal retards here
I learned more about you in this exchange than u/247drip   Fucking retard
Smart man
Yeah waiting for jan to rebalance and add more calls and shares. Dont want to realize any more gains before 2021. January is gonna be a good month for us retards. I can feel it in my left nut
More than 50% gains just in tech etfs.
Mt
NIO, I‚Äôd say BABA if you go a little longer
Streaming is recurring subscription revenue bro. That is far far different than retail hardware sales. Cope all you want but this thing is at the top. Best case scenario from here is a slow grind upward but lagging the overall market.
Not a bad ideaü§î

Oh nio, the day of hitting $50 is never gonna happen. Fuck me
it‚Äôs an over reaction. must be rebounding next week. ü§ûüèª
lol BABA is nothing compared to the CCP - they could nationalize this company tomorrow or transfer 100% ownership to Winnie the Pooh and you would just have to take it up the ass
Christine lagarde? Really? You need help. Bro.
Hard not to buy a dip like that! Why would China want to handicap their biggest online marketplace? imo it‚Äôs more of a show of who‚Äôs the boss
No way lol
Serious question. Why do y‚Äôall do options ? Like compared to just buying regular stocks. Or even spreads which are a lot more likely to make money. I feel like half the time people lose money and a lot of it when playing naked calls or doing puts.

True but that really is fuckin dick move on managements part.
Nio is just a leech growing on Tesla. I wouldn't trust it
You can magnify your wins/losses with less capital it would require to just invest/trade on the stock alone.  Also, you can accelerate your wins/losses at a time frame of your choosing.

Just read CRSR‚Äôs outlook update from November end and it kinda made my PP hard  Glad I bought more on the dip today fuck everyone who is selling
Lmao.. you ever been in a Benz you poor bastard!
Ban again
Think of it this way. Lets say you got $50,000 in Amazon. But hey, you know this shits going up over the next year. Buy call leaps 6-8 months out, and for the same move you would have made 2-4x more with the options than just holding the underlying. Obviously this is an example, sometimes you buy calls too far out it may not move as much, etc etc, but you get the point.
buttcunt?
Baby 4-digit portfolio here.   I have 100 GME shares. Should I buy 25c Jan29 and sell 25c Jan15 to offset the premium cost?

Pretty sure the safe bet is leaps on blue chip tech winners you are confident about.  Shares with margin for everything else.  For me its 50/50, sometimes I worry that I am not diversified enough.  Then I come to WSB and my approach seems very responsible.

They did talk a little bit about how it‚Äôs unknown if growth will slowdown in the post covid world, but they also pointed out how untapped their total market is in terms of new customers so who is to say  Personally bull on gaming and esports in the future in general and CRSR seems like a company that can manage financial metrics well (so far) so that‚Äôs also a plus

I chose the mid/small cap fund over the target date fund and so far it has returned like 58% YTD. Pretty sure the target date fund did a lot worse. Make sure thoroughly go through all your choices.

Also, they position themselves as a developed country w baba, which is important for the regime. Nationalizing it will hurt their image, and w a new President coming in, I‚Äôm not sure they‚Äôd wanna do that. &amp; possible China trade deal w Biden
Haha I‚Äôm waiting outside in the rain for some ribs they clearly overbooked what they could handle. Lucky for me, my Benz is 20 years old and a piece of fucking shit. Just needs to last me until my Cybertruck is ready.

Definitive agreement
are we Seriosuly going to view cathie by her gender now. She's a talented investor, period.
Its bullshit that they can trade at times we cant. They get a huge advantage and can make moves off good/bad news when the rest of us cant
Its fine
Great point to begin a scale in but hold off on going balls deep rn...it‚Äôs going to be downside sensitive for a little while   CCP antitrust might not be like US antitrust. All antitrust is just politics and as a market we have far less insight and predictability in CCP.

Saw this DD post on stocktwits [https://stocktwits.com/YOLOYOLOYOLO/message/267214058](https://stocktwits.com/YOLOYOLOYOLO/message/267214058). I personally believe the statement on MMs manipulating the stock a little to keep it flat. It has been unusually flat for a stock in such sector with a lot of attention
No
This is why I got $50k in shares and $5k in options
Oh yeah idk why anyone buys that shit.   Some peeps just want to spend money to flex I guess
No one here thinks they‚Äôre the next Warren Buffett, more like the next Michael Burry timing the top

What‚Äôs the best plan for the weekend? I want to prepare for Monday but don‚Äôt know what to do.
Real question is can Melvin capital force GME any lower on Monday non organically? Barely any shares left to short and already bought ton of outs that are now out of the money, and BABA has tanked for them putting them further under water
It's a rocket ship, with a cracked heat shield, it's fine while it's traveling in space but any bad news and that baby is going to blow.

It‚Äôs hard to imagine while we‚Äôre in a raging bull market but eventually this bubble will pop and when it does those tickers will fall the hardest. Everyone knows these valuations make no sense. Every retard on this sub with a 2 week old robinhood account is making money fomoing into meme companies that have never earned a dime of profit and probably never will. You really think that is sustainable? It could be in 3 months it could be in 12 months but a crash is coming and when it does people like you will hold all the way down.
And she‚Äôs hot, of course we‚Äôre gonna view her by her gender when 90% of this sub wants to fuck her. That she‚Äôs a talented investor is a plus
Your flair intrigues me

Sounds about right.

Usually slice it up in 1/2 inch pieces on a steel pan, cut some of the fat off to get a coating. It renders insanely fast. Cook about 30 sec or so each side whatever gets a nice sear.

I've had this exact same sentiment. My feeling is once these moratoriums expire, it's going to cause a massive snowball effect specifically in the housing market.   Interest rates are low due to big money moving to bonds and out of the market due to uncertainty. When evictions start up again (due to record unemployment and eviction notices, and americans are so far behind on rent) then homeowners will take advantage of the current high prices and evict and sell the first chance they get. But I'm assuming nobody will be buying, leading to market flood and house prices dropping.   When house prices start falling, all of a sudden people are upside down on these inflated homes they bought because the mortgage rates are so low right now.   I'm a doomsayer sure, but I see NO other outcome than a housing collapse right now.   But I'm also retarded, so.
To be fair most wouldn't care not remember it but I'm sure it would help out a few people. Those that want to show off will always be in debt up to their eyeballs.

Was buying the dip on FUBO shares around $42 since it has good support around $40 but wasn't clear on why it was dropping off a cliff.      Now I know: https://twitter.com/RichLightShed/status/1342117742212734978      This idiot has a $8 price target. He is also the same one who gave a Sell rating for Disney when it was $85 earlier this year. Seems like this dumbass with a punchable face does not understand streaming nor sports betting.

Gotta play the options game at, or near merger date. I got screwed over on $DM calls too. I guess its all a learning curve
Depends on your normal base hourly pay. Some people here make much less or much more than $27 so it's not much of a question.
never faked gain porn so you won't be able to provide proof.

Ok I have enough of. Beistand and of my family which treats me as a retard. Can the markets open already ?
Why not just by a last gen gpu. You are paying a premium for very little bump in performance.
Depends on what the job was
Didn't log in at all today. Didn't read the comments on wsb. Didn't check my positions. Sometimes you just gotta say fuck it and chill.
Is she a shorting goddess?
I‚Äôm assuming you lean WORK, and it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs been bought out by CRM and is trading at exactly the range the buy out calls for.... come on people, how many of you dumbasses are seriously buying options post buyout

I think you‚Äôve got a part of it right.   I seriously doubt that China intentionally let the virus loose...but the CCP made a conscious decision to allow it to spread beyond China‚Äôs borders.  Their economy would have been completely left behind by the world if COVID was a China-only virus.

Wham! Last Christmas
Look at the 5 or 15min chart for this week. After the first gap up it's been pinned right under 132 all week. Every time it got below 131.80 calls starting pouring in for 1/15 and 2/19. They just needed to accumulate and shake out the weak hands for the real run. 2/19 145 calls were hot.
caught you lying in the past so I've started making it a habit.

Everyone‚Äôs talking about how much they lost on their BABA shares. Who knew you guys bought and held *shares* for longer than a week?
buy the dip
This bitch is rocketing to 1000 the second the ARM acquisition closes
Went with shares. Calls actually seemed kinda expensive. Ofc I'll regret this if it moons 5% Monday.
I dont trade full time.  Do my research nights and weekends, set alerts on think or swim, and then i trade off those. Still check the market periodically throughout the day, but dont stare at it
Imagine being from another country and getting like $2k a month all year. How many calls we could've bought if our country wasnt ran by some bitches.
I still trust Thiel and Li to find a quality target. They‚Äôre still going for a big company in that area even if Tokopedia falls through. One of my favorite SPACs

Got some $28 and $30 calls expiring 1/15. Decent amount of time left, but I dunno, the price action the last two days hasn't looked especially promising. Think we got more downside ahead of us in the short term?
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
I'm only playing $20k. WSB isn't memeing it yet so by the time they realize what's going on I'm hoping to exit those positions at big profits and switch over to theta and day trading weeklies on it
Yep puts on BABA and all China internet related shit is the way to go in the short term and maybe long term however things shake out.  Jack Ma is fuuuuucked
Did half of this damn sub own BABA calls? WTF?
Wait how has it been trading flat for 3 months? Amazon actually has been trading flat for 3 months, not WRK though.

BABA is totally undervalued. I don‚Äôt want to get fucked by Xi though.
Did you have the funds under the LLC or in your name?
oh interesting i was going for the former situation as well, but figured the suffering "feeling" most of the time would be worse than the actual poor financial situation

I FOMOed into a 1/8 $220C. Probably a bad idea so I managed to limit myself to one.
You use it to patch holes in your wall.
BABA briefly went negative YTD today (it's now up 2% YTD end of day today). Very few tech stocks this year are -YTD. Only ones I can think of are Intel and Cisco, but those 2 literally have no growth.
Would I? No  Should you? Do you need the money? That‚Äôs what $600 or so after taxes?  How much did you make today from stonks
Baba bruh. They axed it in India.
Imagine closing early just bc it‚Äôs a holiday when your business needs all the customers it can get this year
Appreciate it! Thanks
HAVE HAD SO MUCHH WINE 2Nite LETZ FUCKIN GO
Yeah toned down comment in the name of goodwill for fellow man during holidays but exactly right.
There are good dips and bad dips. This is not a good dip, retarded fuck.
Idk why I went so hard on dailies today but I blew through 300 on GME and PLTR today lmao
No, but that big drop was too juicy for likely more than half of this sub to resist.... 220/230 spreads for next week for ~$3ish was my weakness

Wtf. Just think what happens when someone shorts a stock
Wait I think it's more like if there are more buyers than sellers -&gt; stock goes up. If there are more sellers than buyers -&gt; stock goes down.   Shorting is just another way to "sell", as in its selling without owning the stock, so it adds to the sell pressure overall. Of course since they don't own the stock, if they are wrong, they have to quickly buy back (cover) adding to the buyers side, causing these short squeezes.

One word - Panic. Just remember shorters sell stock they dont own thinking it will go down and they will return the stock by purchasing at a lower price. They borrow and sell stock of a company they feel is under pressure. If correct, they get to purchase it cheap and return the value keeping the difference.If wrong they lose their pants.

It doesn't. In fact, if you just bought shares in the 15 most short stocks on a rotating basis, let's say monthly or semi-annually, you would outperform the market.
Shorting a stock is essentially borrowing shares you don‚Äôt have to sell at market price, which forces the price of the stock down because the market orders are now fulfilled. Then, the short seller buys the shares at the lower stock price and returns them to the brokerage they borrowed them from.

How u feelin homie,
There is no "set" price for a stock. Buyers place bids, and sellers place asks and whatever matches becomes the latest price. When people short, not only does it increase the number of sellers, they're motivated to sell so they're likely to move their ask price down to the bid. So the bids will just keep getting lower and lower, and the asks will have to come down if they want to sell.   This is why it's a good idea to look at the bid and ask spread when buying things, and why volume and open interest is important.
Buying from other retailers feels good and they‚Äôre so thankful for your service. Even send you thank you cards and shit lol

IWM and small caps are also in a bubble imo. IWM is up 25% on the year with the worst earnings outlook for 2021. I understand the recovery trade but that‚Äôs fucking priced in dawg besides maybe a couple names. Since small caps, cloud/security/gaming/ecommerce, EV/solar, mid cap tech are all ‚Äúovervalued‚Äù there‚Äôs only two safe havens in the market to throw money in and get a guaranteed return.... mega cap blue chip tech and SPACs. FAANG and SPACs might as well be the new bonds for 2021. How retarded?
We are weak. We deserve this
I'm doing great too! I have short term memory loss like Dory so I already forgot what I lost in BABA today.

Reinfections are common given the opportunity [[1]](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/khsw6u/scientists_urge_concern_not_alarm_over_new_virus/ggo8qir/). Reinfections can be used to estimate anti-body half life for anti-bodies created by the vaccine. [[2]](https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/antibody+half-life). Reinfections can also be used as an indicator for B cell immunity, as B cell immunity created via a infection is the same as B cell immunity created by a vaccine. [[3]](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html). Yes, vaccines do provide a greater initial antibody count than a natural infection, but the anti-body half life is the same and short as indicated by reinfections. Bi-annual vaccine boosters are not logistically feasible.  If antigenic drift reduces efficacy rapidly, its a problem. Its not possible to vaccinate for multiple versions bi-annually. [[4]](https://twitter.com/trvrb/status/1340409968818671616?s=20). "Immune Evasion" can already be seen occuring in the South African strain [[5]](https://sciencespeaksblog.org/2020/12/22/covid-19-south-african-variant-may-be-worse-than-uk-variant/). Suspiciously, there are also 1594 untested and suspected cases in fda report for pfizer vaccine, in vaccinated group. [[6]](https://www.fda.gov/media/144245/download).

Like almost 50% of his holding is AAPL. It's actually funny since buying BRK is like buying a stake that has 50% AAPL but many don't know that.   He probably won't buy BABA with these issues, but if he does, he'll do it directly on HK. I always thought he should buy MSFT but I guess he never will with his friendship to Gates. The next best opportunity was Disney (a safe, boomer stock that has growth) when it dipped to 90 earlier this year, and he didn't do that either...

It's the other way around. Tech stocks have become too overpriced so money is rotating into small caps now.  Because of QE and stimulus, the dollar has been getting killed, so people are just rotating money around looking for a safe haven that still has some juice left to squeeze.  Compare QQQ and IWM since the crash. QQQ went gangbusters until Sept. and has slowed down since. IWM was fairly muted in the recovery, but has taken the lead since the end of Sept.

Investing in things that are "good" or civically responsible   is great and all if you believe in the company and/or are worried about having "ill gotten gains", but this is all being traded on the secondary market so you're not financing the company directly.   If you were buying their products or their corporate bonds I get it, you're helping the company, or if youre some pre ipo investor, but otherwise i think its just gambling with extra steps. I agree that it's ridiculous.

Can someone less retarded than me explain the percentage of ETF in the ARK daily emails? For example, look at Google for today. Cathie bought .2681 of google for ARKG.

Yes I did a Jun 250 and jan'22 260. Those seem like such easy targets, I'd be shocked if they didn't hit for me after all my previous fails...

I imagine being a Perma-Bear is hoping for the downfall of society .  You want things to get worse for other investors, regular average people, working people trying to make ends meat.  You want people you know to financially suffer and you hope to profit off of that suffering.  I can't imagine living my life like this, wanting catastrophic bad things to happen to people for my own selfish gain.

No, we want the market to fairly value things, including labor, buttfuck. When asshole bulls like you drive up energy/commodity prices and short bonds (driving up interest rates), then the economic recovery never happens, and wage earners suffer more. Also, your speculative booms drive up housing and other costs making it harder on wage earners, who are most of the population. Go fuck yourself with a splintery 2x4.

In reality, the world doesn‚Äôt work like that. They get absolutely blown the fuck out most of the time and they spend a lot of time sitting on the sidelines slinging mud and hate at the market and anyone making money off of shares and calls, refusing to accept that their own toxic mindset is holding them back.

I think it's more about the bears thinking the market is overvalued and does not reflect the level of suffering from the pandemic. They're looking for the massive dip to buy in... but that dip hasn't come yet.
No big bad news. No reason to plunge at all but heard talk of it running it‚Äôs run, I still think it has some steam in it for NiO day. Such a fucking bummer it‚Äôs on a Saturday. And with Biden coming in Chinese EV car companies might be the move..

AMC shares are so cheap rn I might buy in. Movie theaters will be popping once the pandemic is over. If they file for bankruptcy they likely get to renegotiate their leases.

Golden Nugget is the only iGaming company that‚Äôs already profitable because of physical location and it‚Äôs already up n running, it‚Äôs the second public iGaming stock and besides draftkings there‚Äôs no other public iGaming company to invest in, also their CEO is richer than Mark Cuban and an amazing businessman who owns many companies like Landry‚Äôs restaurant group (bubba gump shrimp, mortons, etc) as well as a lot more, he‚Äôs always on CNBC everything he touches turns to gold. The merger goes through Tuesday and if you do your research you‚Äôll see that it‚Äôs virtually guaranteed to merge, ticker will change soon too. It‚Äôs volume and buyers are ATH along with its stock price, up AH, and people are beginning to FOMO. I‚Äôm increasing my position Monday while I can. This is going to be big. Gambling at home is the future.
BABA TO THE MOON!

I would only leave to jump 2x into ICLN or IPOC
Lol auto mod now flags and removes you for mentioning a certain mod leaving and the current quality of the sub now that he‚Äôs gone

i don't have much because it was all boomer shit forever that barely grew &amp; i didn't put much in until last few years. back then i was still paying like $10 to make a trade on shares so i didn't get into actively investing until semi recently, last couple years.
I swear, leaving tons of money on the table feels worse than losing it all.

This government rarely shocks me but it is straight shocking how much of a mess stimmy talks are
I'm 29, still can't wrap my head around why anyone who has been working this year needs a stimulus check. From what I can tell most people made more money this year, and anyone who didn't or lost a job had massive unemployment supplementation earlier in the year, and also are now getting like 11 more months x 300 which is pretty good.      Juicing the economy at this point with needless stimulus for people like me who had a job all year will get taken back via inflation AND THEN SOME. All you're doing by pounding the table for stimulus is propping up boomer retirements until they die and leave you with an even bigger fucking bag that your dumb ass essentially begged for. The are shitting on younger generations and you guys are just fucking lapping it up like good little dogs.      FUCK THAT. I would love if they would stop manipulating/propping up an economy so that people young enough would have a chance at actually affordable houses and stocks, but nope, you guys would rather try striking it rich on a gambling sub because subconsciously you know it's your only fucking shot at the American dream because the boomer financial engineering has royally fucked you out of a legit shot at wealth accumulation.     But yeah, more stimulus please, that way when I eventually reach retirement age all the gains will have been milked dry by boomers and the dollar will have been so debased that any entitlements I get like social security will be paid out in worthless fucking fiat.      Fuck you people dumb.
they bought a shit load of tencent, but no BABA
I sold around same price, I am not sure I regret it, they are overvalued bigly and bound for a correction.

Only dipshit Americans. Actual poor people who are out there starving to death right now are waiting for our shit to collapse so they can start ganking our shit instead of dying for us to gank theirs. American society treats me like shit for having enough of a moral compass to care more about those people which just makes me care even less about American dipshits and even more about those people. The few American people I know who are decent human beings are free to turn to me for help with survival if things get truly bad for them, my preparations are meant to let me secure the survival of more than just myself, but for the most part the world's rich people such as the US can get fucked for all their murder and thievery
How are those going for you?
Amc has literally went down the last 5 yrs with year over year great movies constantly beating each others box office records. And yet they still constantly went down. If they can't go green when everything was going great I highly doubt them ever doing it

#Holds Up Sign
It's all long term positioning. The key is the us house in 2022. Dems barely kept their majority. R need a weak economy and the house flips in 2022 because the incumbent party gets blamed for whatever happens between now and then. It positions them better for a 2024 run with a generic boring R (cotton, hawley etc) and a chance at all three houses for the first time since 2017

not exactly. Just because you file for bankruptcy doesn't mean the company is shutting down. It allows them to restructure their debts and/or get bailed out by a large company/government. Of course some companies shut down if their restructuring doesn't work, but AMC isn't going to. All they need is time right now for their business to reopen
8 year Bull rally ahead
Oh that's good
I truly hope so
You are right on one thing, the dream is a complete joke and the only way to make it is to gamble on things like WSB.  However 600$ is a drop in the bucket an every dollar you give to the average public gets pumped right back into the economy.
Bought 4400 shares of ICLN at like 16 bucks and 1400 shares of BLNK at 7.50ish. ICLN going to 100 would be absolutely fucking insane.

You know what's better than 600 dollars to placate the masses? How about not 600 dollars, and a free fucking market that doesn't inflate asset prices faster than you can catch up to them creating massive generation wealth inequality.      If 600 dollars is enough to make the peons quiet down then money well spent by the boomers I guess.        I'm still waiting for you or anyone to tell me why it makes any sense at all in a year when most people have actually made more money than they would have otherwise, and those that didn't got massive unemployment benefits. Rip the Band-Aid off, kill the zombie companies, burn out the overgrowth. Then instead of hoping you're one of the lucky ones to have an inheritance passed down, you could idunno, have a shot at assets at non manipulated/inflated prices?     This sub would rather beg for a handout which will just end up perpetuating them getting fucked in the end. Seems short sighted.

"Japan tried several fiscal policy measures to break out of its liquidity trap, but it is generally believed that these measures were not executed well‚Äîmoney was wasted on inefficient public works projects and given to failing businesses. Most economists agree that for fiscal stimulus policy to be effective, money must be allocated efficiently. In other words, let the market decide where to spend and invest by placing money directly in the hands of consumers. (For related reading, check out What Is Fiscal Policy?)"

Pretty sure he tried but dems kept shutting it down. The polls said he was going to win a second term so they started blocking everything even if it included helping americans. Speaking of that there was a thing in 2017 that included the wall money before he got it via EO. The bill included the money AND mandatory parental leave for 10m+ corporations. It was one of the biggest wins ever for dems and parent related work rights. Reps put it in so trump could get unlimited wall money, it was a great compromise but they blocked it since it would hand trump a win. THEY BLOCKED MANDATORY PARENTAL WORK LEAVE.

We aren't in a 1:1 situation in comparison to Japan's Lost Decade but I do think it's the best comparison we have for what mistakes to avoid and where we may end up.  Big difference is we don't have a credit crisis yet, but who knows what will happen. Auto loans/commercial real estate seem like the weakness right now.

I'd probably buy BABA shares if it hits pandemic levels at around 180. Or LEAPS. TIL LEAPS is an acronym for Long Term Equity Anticipation Security. I thought they were named LEAPS because leaping lets you travel a longer distance than just taking a step.

Most of it just slots together. All you need to do is makes sure your motherboard supports your cpu (correct socket). Spreading thermal paste isn't all that scary but most amd CPUs come with some paste on them already if you don't want higher grade stuff.  Then just grab some ram, an SSD, and a gpu. Also a power supply which I would suggest to not skimp on, high rated psus are more energy efficient and less liable to break and if you go overboard with the amount of power supply you future proof yourself to stuff like newer gpus requiring lots of power.

I was just wondering that myself
With calls, when do you guys normally sell your positions?   I usually buy monthlies (or further out if price is okay) and have been selling with plenty of time left and before decay (&gt;2 weeks left) to give me cushion in case it drops.   Last few plays, the underlying has skyrocketed after I sold with plenty of time (PRPL and RIOT for example), so I realized 30-75% gain instead of 5x+.   How do you guys balance being safe and closing out for a marginal gain versus holding?

Yeah - agreed, but it's tough when you see shit rally after closing when you have time left.  For those 600% calls, I'm curious when you are happy with the gains and sell? Like you had to make a conscious effort to hold pass 200%, 300%, etc. In other words, when is it enough to sell.  I'm always worried that if I hold, the underlying could tank and I can see my gains get wiped out, which has happened all too many times.

carts/pods are the same thing essentially - if bought from shady places they may be cut with Vitamin E Acetate or other similar agents. Long term use of shady carts may cause you to develop a relatively dangerous and deadly pneumonia which used to only be found in nursing room patients on oxygen. Furthermore, carts are sometimes cut with spice/k2 to ‚Äúenhance the high‚Äù. These are horrible for you. Long term consumption of synthetic cannabinoids WILL cause you to develop mental problems such as bipolar disorder, depression, and even psychosis.   Smoking bud in joint form repeatedly carries many of the same risks found in smoking - while the risk of cancer is much lower than smoking cigarettes, it can still happen. More importantly, long term joint/cart smoking can cause widespread lung issues such as COPD.   TLDR:  Edibles &gt; Dispensary Carts &gt; Dispensary Weed &gt; Regular Weed. In my opinion I wouldn‚Äôt take the risk of street carts. They used to give me mad headaches and definitely we‚Äôre not good for me.

While he has the gravitas his base loves, four years out of the spotlight and america's penchant to forget about people once they're out of the spotlight could end up sinking his candidacy. Of course this is assuming he doesn't launch trump tv and become a 24 hour eye sore

I lost 4K earlier this year on BA. I just finally broke even and was about 300 in the green until BABA sold the fuck off today. Hoping it will bounce back by 1/15. Thankfully it‚Äôs a short put so I can take assignment if it doesn‚Äôt pass 230  Here‚Äôs to 2021

Merry Christmas to you all!
It's my biggest position. Been buying lots even at these prices.  [https://twitter.com/RuncieDan/status/1341996884416598017](https://twitter.com/RuncieDan/status/1341996884416598017)
Thanks this basically answers my question. I buy from someone who gets it from the dispensary. I usually use carts but he‚Äôs out and only has pods. Plug play and stizzy are the options. So assuming it‚Äôs legit and similar to carts they‚Äôre both safe and essentially same as smoking just flower?
Holy shit, comments getting deleted left and front
Is it rly though
Have you ever heard of forex?

I want thiel to dock into elons cybertruck
Not enough for sure, I‚Äôve been kind of trading off my own gut. I have started looking at RSI, MACD, and Volume indicators but I definitely think I need more experience to make confident plays off those  I haven‚Äôt done terribly portfolio wise, I bled from 7000 all the way to 1.8k on SLV calls (what didn‚Äôt help was that I took a day trade ban and diamond handed the slv calls hoping for a pump that never came) from July to November 4, but am now back up to 6.2 on my Robinhood from NIO, QQQJ, PLTR, JOE, CRSR, and GME weeklies being my biggest gains
I love watching cooking shows. Can‚Äôt cook for shit tho and have no interest trying

Haha I been hooking up with Cathy Jensen,  accounting. She‚Äôs an absolute missile, but I‚Äôd never let a chick peg me. Johnson, marketing said he did once. Definitely more of a marketing guy thing. Idk anyone in Finance who would get pegged.

Thanks he who cannot be named after yesterday
does it scan individual stocks?
If he is heating a potato then adding butter and bacon or something to it, then eating it, it is a baked potato.   Even if the heating occurred wrapped in paper towels in the microwave.
Friends are ok but a girlfriend is a better start. It can be very awkward in the beginning, so having a relationship with your model can help a lot. I built my portfolio by reaching out to models on Instagram. You can definitely offer your work for free in the beginning, but I would try and keep that to a minimum (maybe let them use some shots on their social media). Goodluck!
I think so, it seems to be the move lately, just get out when it pumps.  Pick one that looks like it has potential to get some momentum via who owns it or the bs product they may sell
During the March crash, some SPACs did drop under $10 but not too much, stay above $9 and went back up above $10 eventually. Biggest downside I guess is waiting for it to do something while missing out on other trades. Once the merger completes though, no more $10 floor.
Saw a post yesterday that one of the mods quit and turned off some bots
Woahhhhh what adodge
Should just put them both in the microwave and see which one turns out better
Merry lockdown
But the charts are calling my name.
Apollo bro  0 ads and much better browsing experience
She's not wrong
Depends on if I see a large catalyst in the horizon, if the news has hit then I definitely sell.  I'm currently sitting on some gme calls that have appreciated a lot but I feel confident that better gains are on the horizon so I'm chilling. Usually I'm happy to leave at 50-100% gain though, reminding myself that that amount of gain blows away what you'd get with regular stock.  I also spent like 70$ on 35$ calls that were worth like 800% more and I almost definitely should've sold before they went back to earth but I sometimes I just need to scratch that itch lol
Ublock origin
Hey sodomites, what‚Äôs the play for Monday?
I hate the guy but I will tell you something. He did shake up the normies and they'll never be the same. Not the political process because absent a civil war that won't change.  But he basically shattered normal political positions among voters. Take a look at the nytimes analysis of how major cities shifted towards trump this year. He effectively convinced a group of younger minorities that voting D means you're a wage slave forever and voting R means a chance at prosperity.   Bad dude all around and one if I shook hands with I'd check all my pockets and wrist to make sure nothing was missing but he was highly effective at breaking up the passive political thought pattern
What kind of ads do you mean. Like 100 posts bout PLTR and GME?
Here‚Äôs some flair bitch

Self discipline is self respect is self love. Stop hatin bro
I can't enjoy Xmas cause of what BABA did to me. I need BABA to go back up at least 10% next week or I give up my dreams. Bye time to stop thinking about stocks
I can relate to this kind of retard shit
Uhhh did anyone else just randomly get 800 coins?
**NOW IS THE TIME TO BUY CALLS ON SPYDER**

How quickly does BABA get back to $300?
O thank u. I swallow.

Big mistake, you're an idiot
You're right though. Foil does two things. 1. Takes longer to heat up. 2. Traps moisture in the potato so you don't get no crackly oily skin. What a joke.
Thank you!

That's fucking hot
As far as I'm concerned every other user is a bot and reddit is a one player game
What songs do y'all listen to while you trade? I've been throwing this one on a lot lately: [Sisters of Mercy - Dominion / Mother Russia](https://youtu.be/0NqBJQksIIo). I like it because it was written at the tail of the cold war by some British goth intellectual and it shouts out Ozymandias and then compares Lloyd's of London to blind men and mine workers and accuses Reagan of being a Russian puppet and it ends on a posadist prayer for Russia to nuke America but if you play it in reverse it says "have mercy" a bunch of times so that there's some voodoo shit going on where every time you play it you might think you're praying for nuclear dominion but actually you're being cancelled out by a prayer for world peace. Pretty nifty shit. I feel like it gets the devil to stay out of my way and I can just vibe with Putin the richest man alive and f e e l the market when this song is playing. Right now I'm listening to it and it's telling me the market is closed so yep the sixth sense checks out
could be a while. today was a write off tho. every hhigh flying stock sold off on low volume

Dude, having a hot wife is super dope. The debt isn't fun. But maybe take a closer examination of the drinking. I'm sure your hot wife would be less likely to run if you're not drunk all the time... Hope you have a good Christmas!

Yep, agreed with you here. I'm normally looking at the stock price as well, but in most cases, the option price follows pretty squarely.

This is exactly my reasoning for holding GME after Q3 earnings did the same thing.

**[List of people pardoned or granted clemency by the president of the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List of people pardoned or granted clemency by the president of the United States)**  This is a partial list of people pardoned or granted clemency by the President of the United States. The plenary power to grant a pardon or a reprieve is granted to the president by Article II, Section 2, Clause 1 of the Constitution; the only limits mentioned in the Constitution are that pardons are limited to federal offenses, and that they cannot affect an impeachment process: "The president shall ... have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment".Though pardons have been challenged in the courts, and the power to grant them challenged by Congress, the Court has consistently declined to put limits on the president's discretion. The president can issue a full pardon, reversing a criminal conviction (along with its legal effects) as if it never happened.

GME already exploded this week, next week is our turn, you can have the week after that.

That sweet spot where you are down thousands in your overall realized cost basis for the year but you have unrealized winners you can cash now without tax stress üôå
It's actually 100% bangers.  No words so it's not distracting, and it's all fast paced, driving beats.  I honestly keeps me focused better than any drug.
You think I should still hold GME or get out while I can? Bought like an idiot at 20.95 today
I'm taking the high road.  you're taking a lower road  than a former meth addict.

You sir; why the fuck are you living in a cardboard box?

Lgd, mk 677, cardarine and yk11.     Lgd, I fucked up and took too huge a dose and had shutdown, but 3 weeks back to normal.
Yeah I feel like what sucks about wsb is that most of the talk around here has happened after things have run up and not before. I fucking wish I had seen someone talk about gme earlier in the year

No doubt. I remember reading the report and staying away. It's either the next big thing or the next Enron given how lofty the expectation are for it
not if this au pair chick wants to fuck  so yeah me too
If you're ever looking to change it up, LittleBigPlanet soundtrack is good for the less intense trading days especially if you get any nostalgia from it
Got that on my rotation too. Outstanding for your trades.  "Wit' my mind on my money and my money on my mind"
Get out now, buy back later. Hold PLTR, might have a big move during the next week.
Yea for sure
You have an ELO score too that the algos look at based on what type of women are swiping on you. Unless the 10s are also swiping you back, then it treats you like a robot. Swipe the type that swipes you and then it will keep showing you yo those types
Oh yah that‚Äôs not good at all. Esp with light beers like that, there‚Äôs almost no alcohol in them. Sorry to hear that bro, I‚Äôm sure in a few years we‚Äôll be able to grow replacement livers.  Or we could just go to China for a parts swap

Even geothermal joined the energy rally-- ora is up 50 percent in 3 months.  I always wondered if congress renewed the subsides for this if solar would lose market share. It's a low maintenance system and the energy is limitless

Again? If so, it's because STIC's market cap is under $1bn. Think as of EOD it's like 540 MM, so it's easy to manipulate currently.

Did you buy calls or shares. Because the RSI is high so I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see a pullback but it‚Äôll rebound. So if you have shares you‚Äôll be good

Fuck the dipshits on Twitter giving the guy a hard time when he is on vacation with his family.  we all know that here we shrug off losses and laugh it off.  Even if he werent on vacation nobody can fucking predict what communist China will do to protect the communism.
looks uncomfortable for sitting.
How are you even concerned lol
I get that the funds are amazing, but isn‚Äôt it just driven by Tesla and apple and stuff?  I‚Äôm sure anyone that buys Tesla has done better than 100% return this year.  More curious about how many of the other picks are winners after she buys them

Xi admired Mao. He believes in core tenet of communism. He is pragmatic and learnt from mistakes of other communist countries. No need for state owned companies when you have control over private sector.
If it bothers him that much maybe he should just log off twitter. He's a grown ass man fuck him. It's words on a screen at the end of the day.

You deserve to lose all your money to gay bears in a big crash and you probably will. There is justice in the world
If the skin is still on, then the flesh is steamed in both of these preparations bro. Theyres a ridiculous amount of water in a potato. That's why you don't see any maillard reaction in the flesh no matter how high your oven goes

Get the timing wrong then bitch
It‚Äôs basically a casino at this point.  If it‚Äôs on the watch list, you‚Äôre going to miss the move while you debate if it‚Äôs the right time.  Just throw money around and hope you get lucky.    Do your own DD.  Don‚Äôt chase memes.

Nice, what was your winning position?
don't worry about it, it's no different than when your car wants that  it's specified in bluetooth: [https://www.bluetooth.org/docman/handlers/downloaddoc.ashx?doc\_id=457095](https://www.bluetooth.org/docman/handlers/downloaddoc.ashx?doc_id=457095)  bluetooth is extremely short range, too

I hadn‚Äôt seen that, but I can see why. I‚Äôm holding on this time; I sold CIIC (his previous DD) too early.
I agree. Which is why I asked lol. Pissed at myself for not getting in sooner, although I wonder if it‚Äôs success is largely from its PLUG holdings. Interested to see what 21 holds.
Sorry I‚Äôm embarrassed now
Thanks for the info man, I‚Äôll check it out tonight and look up those terms as well. I really appreciate your help as I am eager to learn more and have done lots of research on companies themselves, just not as much TA / market sentiment stuff.
I‚Äôm with this guy
Happy holidays and merry Christmas mate!

Wait what happened to the mods?
The one that cares left and the rest are are either lazy or salty about jarcuck getting kicked or both.
Lol mitch is pissed at mango
just in case Trump goes to war with Iran?
Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house   Not a short-seller stirring, not even a mouse;   The heavy bags were hung by the chimney with care,   In hopes that St. Powell soon would be there;   The bagholders were nestled all snug in their beds;   While visions of tendies danced in their heads;   And Cassandra in her 'kerchief, and Left in his cap,   Had just settled their puts for a long winter's nap...      Merry Christmas  to all of you!
Got some MT shares, will that do?
It‚Äôs N G A   He already said a week or two ago that‚Äôs his January play
Who knew mango would be out for blood after he didn‚Äôt win? /s
Stonks are fun but family makes life worth it. Hope everyone enjoying Christmas eve or just enjoying their night. I am. No homo, if youre not and dont have anyone to talk to, feel free to send me message tomorrow. I wish all my bull, bear and theta brethen a happy holiday
? Rsi is an indicator. There‚Äôs no ambiguity. It‚Äôs under 30, it‚Äôs oversold. None of those timeframes have an rsi under 60!
LDR's don't count.
New thread dude.
He sold out of the AMZN calls and is down 160k on 285 Facebook calls. Not so sure with theta burn
Thanks for the heads up, I'll post there
The worst vaccine is BCG (for TB).  The area you get the shot would look infected and ooze shit for like 2 weeks.  You will get a scar on your arm for the rest of your life from it.
That was a weird rabbit üêá hole to go down on Christmas Eve!
thank you again for doing these, really appreciate the work you do.
PINS? ROKU? OAC? CRSR? PLTR? DKNG? APLE? AMZN? Already have my MT calls end own some Tesla. Not enough money for all. 20k to invest total. Please put me out of my misery and help.   Also, I‚Äôm a chick. Hope that‚Äôs enough to get me some replies.
They only dropped 33%, I'm pretty diversified so net -5%. I rolled into some leap credit spreads for pltr and saw some gain back
Those who went balls deep in GME calls last week are swimming in both money and panties right now.  If you nut in one of these chicks either tell her jk and she won‚Äôt get pregnant, or just be a gentleman and serve her a delicious Plan B smoothie tomorrow morning as a nice little Christmas gift. She won‚Äôt even know.
Yeah that‚Äôs why I go also. I know it makes her happy so my pain is worth it. Unfortunately my parents aren‚Äôt super worried about Covid and my dad hates wearing masks. Luckily the church as social distanced and it wasn‚Äôt terrible.
so is monday gonna be super red cuz i highly doubt they stimmy gonna be passed...
Don‚Äôt sweat. My ICLN call went down for like 4-5 days straight and then flew and now I‚Äôm up 150%, patience :)
So if the amended 2k stimmy bill doesn‚Äôt pass, can they just override the veto for the original bill or do they have to go through the voting process again?
What did you learn?
Ok what‚Äôs the craic with stimmy
Chest day best day
I got laid this afternoon, Maybe round two coming
600 attached to defense spending bill, but maybe another 2k of trump signs it asap
Stimmy passing and not passing is both priced in.
Spy +3.5% open Monday.
LOL.
"I'm gonna give you my personal line, if you ever need to talk to me, 5 days a week just feel free"
if you apply that logic to stocks like TSLA you'll lose money  yes, RSI is an indicator, imagine interpreting something differently than another person and getting better results  place your bets bro
it will be even funnier when he's right and the CNBC headline is "Trump vetoes stimulus bill.  Millions to lose unemployment insurance."
They somehow broke physics and became even more üåà.
Spy -3.5% open Monday.
Merry Christmas
if it  happens it doesn't matter to me. i have a couple tech plays and then 30% of my portfolio is UUP calls.  but i'll still laugh if bears get fucked again
Why UUP calls? What makes you think the dollar isn't going to continue dying?
merry christmas
rectangle. nnowhere to put your legs . dont want to be lying down oall the time
Wow, someone that has a dollar position.. amazing. You must actually know what you're doing..
nope i'm completely retarded and my logic is "dollar went down, dollar will go back up"  but I promise you it will work  i'll update you a year or two from now
it could go down further, but at the same time if the market takes a dive it works as a hedge  and I can average down on the calls until it starts to recover, which I'm pretty sure it will
With the stimulus sure to pass eventually and the billions being printed each money next year, I don't really see the dollar going up any significant amount. I also don't have a good grasp on what makes the dollar move either so I'm just guessing.
What a great day
Thanks for making a thread "bot" (not bot) mod.
But not today. Tomorrow.
Bulls gonna get DP‚Äôd by Elmo and Clifford Monday morning after Trump vetos the stimulus and the government shuts down.
Turn on Patterns as well. I also create my own trend lines from the past low candles to the low of current candles and vice versa from the top of the highs. I do this from several time periods. The farther out and more candles the line touches the  more confirmation of the trend line and where the stock will move within the future. By using the macd + volume + ttc squeeze I can gauge where the stock will likely move for shorter term trend lines. A good indicator of change is using a triangle where both high and low lines meet within a channel. This is usually at a point of a reversal or stabilizing event.    i have found the market is aware of these points and usually you get a lot of activity if you are looking at the active trader window. Thats where RSI and MACD are important to see if the price has momentum to break up into a higher channel or drop below. Don't be afraid to keep making lines and extending them to patterns that you see. More points confirmed + Time = the more likely the stock will move in that direction.   Granted this does not take in account random events and news breaks that alter the momentum and volume. Even then I have typically seen that price movement will stay within the broader channels. If it breaks the channel I typically account for a correction.   Im new to this as well and have been studying as much as possible. The results have been positive. I was able to gauge aapl and gme movement within +-5 cents for 24hrs allowing for quick trades. Again volatility, news, as well as future time trends in a stock create more unknowns. Once you find the pivots gauge the downside and upside and have a entry exit plan for which way the stock chooses to go. (Options also will need to factor in theta decay) IE the stock hits a channel but the movement is to slow to be profitable.
here's what i've gathered so far:  \- the fed raising rates  \- investors dumping equities for cash  \- weakness of other currencies as a safe haven relative to the dolllar  I saw what happpened in 2008 and when obama left office we had a chad dollar  i think the same thing will happen again but no one wants to admit that the fed has to raise rates eventually -- they will, my calls are for 2023
Becky Quick is such a blatent bitch, I would love to shit in her mouth
yeah it prolly won't set it up that way. each piece is separate and i'd probably go 4 wide and more trinational couch instead of 3 wide and a rectangle
I think the Fed said they'll keep interest rates where it is at least for all of 2021.   2023 expiration, I'm sure rates will go up by then.
Palm day
Look at me, I'm the weekend thread now

Why?
I always feel like as someone who is heavily into ARKG and bought calls on ICLN that I am somehow the conservative 'safe' investor when i come to WSB despite the fact those are still quite risky in the broader financial scheme. Most of my money is in ARKG, ARKW and ICLN because I believe they'll crush it down teh road at prices that are much much higher than what we have now.   I like your distinction though, makes a lot of sense
Is dexamethasone already priced in or are we YOLOing into Pfizer, Novartis, and Merck next?  + https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexamethasone  + Dexamethasone is recommended by the National Health Service in the UK and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the US for patients with COVID-19  + https://www.thomasnet.com/articles/top-suppliers/dexamethasone-manufacturers/  + Top Dexamethasone Manufacturers in the USA: Pfizer, Novartis, Merck
**[Dexamethasone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexamethasone)**  Dexamethasone is a type of corticosteroid medication. It is used in the treatment of many conditions, including rheumatic problems, a number of skin diseases, severe allergies, asthma, chronic obstructive lung disease, croup, brain swelling, eye pain following eye surgery, and along with antibiotics in tuberculosis. In adrenocortical insufficiency, it should be used together with a medication that has greater mineralocorticoid effects such as fludrocortisone. In preterm labor, it may be used to improve outcomes in the baby.

Hanuman is cool  I like Garuda but we never make him for some reason.
Garuda is interesting! But yeah it‚Äôs kinda complex, depending on where you‚Äôre at they have different belief systems. I know some places have Ganesh with a broken tooth on his right side. Some still worship Vedic gods, etc.

Watch PSTH take one of Elon‚Äôs private companies public. Bill was trying to work out a deal with Elon a couple months ago with Howard Hughes Corp &amp; a new Tesla plant in their Texas properties. Don‚Äôt think it materialized, but Bill would be down to worth with Elon
I saw some but I dont trust them as they wont tell you whats up on the 5v5 teamfights where every1 is ulting and shit is going on
Risk and reward can‚Äôt be separated in a (nearly) efficient market, so the more reward you want the more risk you have to take. These things are a spectrum, meaning that you can choose to gamble and invest on the same stock depending on the position you take. PLTR shares or LEAPS (I have 2023 50c) are more on the investing side, where monthlies are still ‚Äúfull casino‚Äù mode
Haha yah why didn‚Äôt I think of that, ‚Äújust stop being poor‚Äù, it‚Äôs so easy!  ü•¥
Schrodinger's stimmy
Nah man, I been on since PIC near nav dawg . plus it's only been public for a few days soooo........
Thats a cheap ass old ass drug
Lmao whatever ur smoking is some good stuff
Are you using your entire margin? half? 25%?
yeah  when I looked at the options for 2023 that was what made be bite the bullet -- the 2023 UUP calls were like popcorn kernels, randomly up or down +/- 20% across the whole spectrum of strike prices  I took that to mean speculators are getting in now so if I get in now I can buy at low IV
I'm literally an idiot, not even joking - I'm new and seriously have no idea what I'm doing, but N G A already has a definitive agreement and merges in February. If N G A really is his play, I wonder what the catalyst would be that would drive N G A up. I also wonder why this catalyst isn't happening for a week or two, causing ComputerTE1996 to say he is waiting to post his DD because "Wsb retards have no patience \[and couldn't wait two weeks\]"

Bingo
Thanks man. I see it as an 800-1000 stock by Jan 2023. Betting accordingly
same
Interesting, will have to take a look at that, thanks.   I actually have a couple of UUP call options but expiring in Jan, was supposed to be a short term trade based on TA and price did what I expected it to do but it happened in the middle of the night and dumped by market open. First time trading UUP so wanted to see how it acts, had less than $20 in it.
perfect question surprised no one has talked about what to get your wife's boyfriend today
And full lockdown for the US until January 5th. THen after that market rises anotther percent to to close 4.5+ pn the day
Yeah same. Just a bit of good news for it and even if it recovered half of what it was and goes to like 30s, that‚Äôll be nice profit for the both of us  And merry Christmas!
My mistake SAM
Thanks you too
Look at their investor presentation. Upcoming facility announcements, truck deliveries to Amazon, etc. So many coming dude, they will have a big Q1 2021
I have a conservative price target of $30 btw for N G A end of January/mid February. and that‚Äôs very very conservative
Keep going you‚Äôll find it.  Not too common of a name - might help
I would not want to see that, but people get too comfortable. They stop working, stop helping, and then it is even harder to throw them out.
Post it with disclaimer .
you're crazy if you think the entire US will lock down, especially before Biden is inaugurated
Thank you autist
The evidence you give is convincing, and a $30+ PT by even 01/31 is very reasonable. That's great and I believe you.  I don't think that it's the ticker he's doing his DD on, though, for one reason: he calls it a risk-free, guaranteed three-bagger, *even without options.* Now it could be that he's talking about warrants (of which, as we know, he's very fond), but it looks to me like what he's saying is that *his price target is triple its current going rate.* I'm not sure of his time frame, of course, but even at a few months out, $55.20 seems *a little optimistic* ‚Äî possible, but too optimistic to call it a *guaranteed three-bagger.* You get what I'm saying? What are your thoughts?
What do you retards do over the weekend to make money? I have a day job working from home and i simultaneously lose all my money making trades on the second monitor. What can i do on the weekends to make money? I get bored and i hate that i look forward to monday.
Fair point. Let‚Äôs see!
Nice lol haha
https://twitter.com/JStein_WaPo/status/1342642411822960640?s=19  If Trimp doesn't sign the bill then mass evictions and expiring benefits hits on Monday.  Fire Sale Monday morning, or sell if you're fully leveraged.
Zero chance lmao get real
You have a good track record, and I'm curious to see what your DD is on, but ain't shit guaranteed.
Boeing 737 max plane flown by air Canada emergency lands due to engine failure warning today.  Puts on BA?
Nope that sums it up
thanks ended even but it was a wild ride im used to around like 1-2 percent up or down in a day cause i usually use stocks but besides the days that i played gme and won hard acouple of days ago that was the fastest movement ive ever seen.
So you‚Äôre back huh? Why did you delete all your posts üòû we still wanna laugh at you üåàüêª

Thanks bro

As long as it doesnt affect the individual calls I picked out spy could hit 340 for all I care
F, well the polls are close so fingers-crossed.  Crazy about the ADs maybe it's just your market?  Headlines are saying biggest Dem spending ever blah blah.  "totally exonerated" is hilarious hmm where have i heard that before.
I‚Äôd buy that dip
[removed]
First, this is a non-event. happens all the time  Second, it's a Rolls Royce engine issue more than Boeing's MCAS issue. I'd love to buy the dip if it panic sells for -1-2% on Monday
He‚Äôs trying to get more for Americans retard. Quit believing headlines they lie to control your brain
No he‚Äôs not. He‚Äôs trying to get attention because he‚Äôs a narcissist. If he cared he‚Äôd sign the bill and push a second payment. Everything he does is based on his narcissism bro.
this is not the first time Ali BABA is being investigated for monopolistic practices. Last time it was investigated for the same reasons it was fined $75,000 US (basically a slap on the wrist).

Hard to do that but I'll take a crack at explaining it a different way.  Compare the political situation right now to earlier this year. There was a time when protests were at peak levels of activity all over the world, driven by massive civil rights protests in the USA during an election year where the election and other tensions had the potential to kick off a civil war by winter.  During a period like that, what happens in the USA is Very important to the global power structure and they put focus on it. They prioritize the situation in the US more than usual, in terms of how much they think about it and just general resource allocation.  When the country you're in has some serious shit like that going on, you are in a chess game with the ruling class where they're a team and you're just a pawn. You have to compete with your fellow pawns as well as the enemy team because the enemy team is trying to take pawns and you want to be one that doesn't get taken. If you're smart this might be a good situation to be in and you might someday make it to the other side of the board and upgrade yourself from a pawn to one of the pieces that can really fight.  When your country is not being focused on, you're not in a chess game against the ruling class with real stakes, you're in a rock paper scissors game up against the other pawns and various pieces all simulating what a real chess game would be like. Since the ruling class aren't trying to maneuver intra-US capital in any particular way right this moment, capital in the US is being moved around with no real stakes. Instead of money being a means to an end, money is the means and the end. So you can't guess what people are going to try to do with money except try to make more money. You can't guess what big money is going to do next except try to be bigger and maybe fail who knows. Really just depends who guesses everyone else's next move right.  This isn't such a good position to be in as a smart person because now it's basically just rock paper scissors. Being smart gives you an advantage, but there's a lot of luck involved unless you limit yourself to only playing against predictable idiots.  Every day, people coordinate a plan for the market designed to trap people into certain trades, and then they look at what trades were made that day to decide the plan for the next day. Each day is a bull trap or a bear trap or a mix of both. If there are too many shorts and they're about to cause a squeeze at a time when it's unwanted, Trump can just tweet a tweet and fix it. If there are too many long positions being held overnight, instead of letting people exercise those calls and hold prices down they can just have the plan be a big dip that day to begin with to shake all those call holders out and move their assets into institutional holdings so the gains can't get anywhere outside the hands of the ruling class.  When the people coordinating the market are under plans to move certain things in certain directions - for example, when help is urgently needed moving capital to manipulate social media to prevent protesters from coordinating - smart traders can exploit these pressures to predict what the overnight plan for the market will be each day.  When all the ruling class are trying to do in your country is pull money out of it for shit they're trying to do in other countries, you lose those outside pressures to predict things by. That's another way of looking at how you get this transformation from a game of chess to rock paper scissors.   Right now, there's lots of protest movements and stuff with momentum in the East but the battle in the West has pretty much been won by the ruling class yet again for now by utilizing the right brainwashing narratives to keep the bipartisan horns locked. Since this conflict heat map happens to align along the east and west right now, it happens to also align the borders between the faux-capitalist hemisphere and the faux-communist hemisphere. So at a time like this, it's more important than usual to prop up faux-communism and less important than usual to prop up faux-capitalism. In fact it seems like they've decided it's worth it to take on some increased risk and instability in the west to strengthen faux-communism where it has a foothold in the East. Like, they're willing to keep the USD sliding no problem right now, among other issues being ignored for the time being. So we're even deeper in rock-paper-scissors territory than usual. Like, there's being on autopilot so the pilot can focus on communications, and then there's being on autopilot so the pilot can go take a shit in the back of the plane and snort some coke. That's how deep we are right now into no fucks given territory. If you notice the market seems retarded and nothing seems to matter, this is why.  -------------------  **Past this line I'm just speculating and not totally certain of my knowledge.**  I believe Putin is **the** global executive managing and coordinating governmental geopolitics for the ruling class and he has been for a long time. He holds that position with an iron fist and he's making things complicated because he wants to hold this exclusive utmost top spot in the world far past his time and so far he has the power to do so. Right now Navalny seems to be leading a charge by detractors to overthrow Putin and do a bit of cleaning house in the global power structure. Putin is just going ham against all detractors as usual, just facing a big charge right now.  Personally, I think they're planning on doing a big market correction and restructuring in the US soon. I'm not sure if they have a set time in mind for it or if they're just waiting until their hands are forced, in which case I'm not sure what will force their hand or when. If I had to guess I'd say we're very close though. Big societal turmoil coming for the US because they're tired of constantly having to micromanage the bipartisan narratives to keep the people's horns locked and they have some kind of ideas about how they can make this particular country less of a hassle for the foreseeable future. It's possible that we'd be in the middle of that chaos right now if it weren't for the fact that we got cucked so hard this year while Eurasia kept acting up, taking some focus off us. I'm not sure if the two different groups represented by Putin and Navalny differ very much in their plans for us, all I'm really sure of is that power struggle is both protecting us from chaos and causing our society to stagnate and fracture with a government in standby mode sleeping at the wheel.

Hey retard, it's up $16
Hey bud, how you doing? How‚Äôs your $2,000 check working out for you that Trump secured for you? ü§° Looks like it was you who suddenly ‚ÄúSTFU‚Äù.
What the fuck does the stimmy check have to do with people he‚Äôs pardoned? Yikes bro, big yikes
He pretended to want $2000 checks on the same day as his pardons. But he never actually wanted $2000 checks. Jesus Christ do I have to draw it out for you with crayons?
Holy shit you are actually a fucking sheep aren‚Äôt you? I don‚Äôt even like Mango and even I know he‚Äôs been advocating for more money for a long time.   I know this will be a shocker to your micro brain, but go ahead and take a look at all the presidential pardons that have happened in the past. There has been controversy with all of them. It‚Äôs part of the system whether you like it or not.
Hey clown. It‚Äôs his own party blocking it. If he actually wanted it he would have been demanding it this entire time. Instead he played golf every day during the negotiations then made his ‚Äúdemands‚Äù after the negotiations were over, and then signed the other bill. The whole thing was political theater to manipulate the very dumbest among us. And it clearly worked, because here you are, confused by the whole thing.
huge Shrek dildo on PLTR what's goin on
SPCE GME PLTR XL CRSR dicking me with no lube
Dude, hope you haven't roped. Have you actually gained any money this week? I hope you haven't YOLOd into something retarded this week. I doubled my money from 0tde last Friday and a +120% 0tde today (both bought and sold within 5mins today). If I was you and yoloding 12k I'd be rich. Let me know
Nah down 20k in a month, not much money or income now maybe it‚Äôs a sign to stop fucking gambling
Maybe if you got 10k buy some TSLA just before close Thursday. I've made 110% doing that past two weeks and I'm an idiot
