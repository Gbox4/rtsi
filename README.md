# Retail Trader Sentiment Index (RTSI)
Developed by Gabe Banks

These are the Python scripts and files I used for pulling data from various subreddits on reddit.com, parsing them, and aggregating them into a database.

A front-end for viewing the final results is being developed at https://rtsi.gabebanks.net, but it is not currently available.
